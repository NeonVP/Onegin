Lenski comes,And wild among them grew her wordsAnd from the Millionaya afarAnd then the stanzas of my themeAnd now, I mournfully confess,And she despite herself would wasteAnd mental elasticity.And now he views forgotten foes,And heard a voice cry_Why! Hes killed!_And the fair sex as light as down!And now upon the snow in thawAnd where the billows hoarsely raiseAnd soon imagination threwAnd by degrees upon him grewAnd buried deep in meditation,And thoughts of Olga first impressedAnd dream of life's delightful dawn?And rising from her bench proceeds;And leans upon the monsters arm,And the recesses of my mindAnd courtier, fop, and usurerAnd due precautions take betimes.And where may be her sister now?And what from its recess appears?And fled afarshe followed me.And soGod bless them, if He list.And lonely through the forest creeps.And I, amid the friendly crowd,And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!And the young revellers of past timesAnd where a madrigal occursAnd may fall headlong any time.And usually despised it too),And lo! he is already there!And wild festivities amongAnd meditative from the spotAnd hastened to his uncles side,And bitter torment never known.And a long time about her talked.And reads with rapid eager eyeAnd naked uniformity.And shut him in a lonely nook.And thus it is twould cause me painAnd natural benevolence,And I admired their common senseAnd an encouragement did breatheAnd after them at headlong paceAnd boiling o'er with friendly heat,And brooding o'er the ills he bore,And by a partial temper stirredAnd the young damsel from the town,And wean unattractive setAnd agitate my heart again;And it may be a secret dreadAnd blest me, sinking to the grave.And Limburg cheese alive and oldAnd the world met her smilingly,And the hearts agitated dreams.And beats with rapid foot the floor.And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.And by that shady rivuletAnd then to meditate for daysAnd soon Lel hovered o'er her head.And loves you asa relative!And my Tattiana now beganAnd yet he in your cause would striveAnd care but little for its ends.And full of innocent delight,And that a bottle sealed with tarAnd I, remembering Svetlana,And happy unto you appear.And wished to say to him farewell.And no ridiculous report,And in the bathroom did commandAnd finally, upon his bedAnd like Napoleons each of usAnd these the attentive maid observedAnd by the world repeated oft,And numerous pages had preservedAnd Agathon replied, amazed.And Eugene ever in her soulAnd grant success to labour long;And pelt him with cherries,And the extent of his caprice;And her voice sweeter than the soundsAnd sulked in silent indignation;And o'er the granite coping bent,And for a time our course delay,And thus each stubbornly proceeds.And marking Tanias agitation,And the bad book accompanies.And wisely gallops to the hill.And past the threshold of decay,And our successors soon shall driveAnd bends her mirror on the moon,And female tears hysterical,And gave himself but little painAnd in a whisper did repeat:And at the table sat her down.And herds of oxen wandering low;And marvels deemed he thus should view.And ought he not to disregardAnd starting suddenly doth say:And others rise ephemeral!And like Childe Harold gloomilyAnd the lime alleys twilight dimAnd in reality one dayAnd many a caravan on highAnd that unrivalled paragon,And impiously should declare,And so departed. But Eugene,And hates the worlds discordant ways.And where tempestuous loves desires,And turned to leave immediately,And what the old man might bequeath.And shorter had the days become.And where the admirable streamsAnd on the footstool sitting downAnd thus ancestral dust reveres.And by a sweet delusion heAnd showed with an uncertain lightAnd from his dressing-room would passAnd homeward like an arrow tore.And town and friends forgotten quite.And privileges nice allowed,And she to whom my lyre would fain,And an elegiac poem wrote.And the cast-iron statuetteAnd Moscow many a beauty fair:And hurried home his awful freight.And vanish like a bird in air.And though I read it with distress,And scanned in silence its content.And glasses unemployed all night;And the attendants called in haste.And such unconsciously he led,And they the waters recommend.And the suspicious veteran old,And in her languid bosom raiseAnd solitude and calm delight.And ringing wine-glasses are plied.And rapid whirl of many feet,And with remorseful anguish filled,And by a genuine sorrow stirred,And grant his weary bones their restAnd stay whose length none recollects.And crossed with trembling hand the maid.And slowly life coagulatesAnd chattering loud sit down to dine.And the old nurse a brief prayer saidAnd would by candlelight arise.And hated casual visitors,And then a cup of coffee drank,And heedless of approval seems,And like a shadow haunted her.And where Thalia softly dreamsAnd lessons to his children read.And her bespangled robe doth waveAnd like the prisoners our delightAnd calmly sleeps the hours away,And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.And clad in airy costume tookAnd devastate the woods around.And leave a marsh the fertile groundAnd an old gent the poet markingAnd the kind-hearted servitors:And with his lot in life content,And comfort of each country dame,And leaning gainst the portal closedAnd thus in season the rich fieldAnd distance interposed in vain,And an habitual sense of pain;And gradually day unfolds.And views amongst themselves advanceAnd disappear in space; then sheAnd all the three to breakfast went;And breathe the balmy breath of night;And blush to own himself reflect.And to the field of honour led;And the sagacious Triquet backAnd fields my joys have ever been;And terrify a swarm of ducks,And he had made her heart beat quick!And led me off to church with song.And pauses oft to serve out bread.And bitter tears of fright I shed.And sometimes into snares as wellAnd breathe a drama in his ear.And in the Summer Garden rove.And traces with a slender fingerAnd enmity and hope and loveAnd soon Onguines door besideAnd breathes upon the chilly glass,And what she from the cards inferred.And the lone secret of her heart,And Flinoff, pensioned councillor,And long internal agitationAnd a boy handed round the cream.And ease and fashionable waste,And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:And every year distributedAnd the young ladies fortunes told,And the Skatnines, aged pair,And true, his pistols faultless aimAnd gallicisms I love as wellAnd oft in whispers would impartAnd mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?And where at last his bones reposeAnd a guitar produced we see,And Eugene soon discovered thereAnd leads a solitary life?And now she skips and now she springsAnd when for Olga nurse arrayedAnd the cold beauties of the season:And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,And a new diadem supplied.And dark and drear the evenings were,And to Onegin far awayAnd death before the husband wideAnd Lenski, closing his left eye,And with gray hair ambrosialAnd lo! five paces more they pass,And visit many a foreign clime,And every morning I awakeAnd a grand festival proceeds.And when the watery mirror gleamedAnd all thy precious elegies,And necessary fools allowed.And gossip of the town and fashionAnd many a day thereafter laidAnd yet the citys flower was there,And all the joys which Winter knows.And never was the ear affrightAnd platitudes and pedantry,And his strange conduct at the danceAnd long her eyes as through a hazeAnd I to give thee cakes was wont?And since I pulled thee by the earAnd by the fiddles rushing soundAnd thus he never fell amongAnd honestly tis my beliefAnd jests doth recapitulate.And exclamations and good cheer.And more imagination teems.And secretly their views expound.And alphabetically triesAnd cannot anything conceal,And thus unto her nurse did say:And be as happyas I might.And in addition youth is flameAnd oft its Dictionary thumb.And madrigals I'm asked to write!And Flinoff, somewhat indisposed,And from the misty woodland nighAnd a malicious epigramAnd gallops to her house away.And gloomy epigrams malicious.And now tis night, the guardian moonAnd following them ye might espyAnd a half rubles down gave she;And to the Bourse the cabman plies;And kindness Tania was impressed,And like his shadow dogged his life,And fits of coughing racked her chest.And then monsieur supplied her place;And cares not farther to proceed;And endless the cotillon seemedAnd soon the friendly troop hath fled.And isolated from all men,And satisfied with vengeance taen.And meditative homeward goes,And the far mountains daintilyAnd Comet champagne foaming flows.And irrigate them with champagne;And never hath our language proudAnd hebut of him presentlyAnd roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;And wheresoeer thy footsteps err,And when her violence reviewedAnd galloped home.

All combineAre all your relatives quite well?Are admirable, my dear friend,Are oft deceptivelike their feet.Are ye replaced by other maidsArising with the mornings light,Around the meadow and the grove.Around my stanzas incompleteAround the garden homeward hies.Around her neck, now violentlyAround the carriage of the pairArouse yourselves, fair ones.Aroused in him some tenderness.Aroused Tattiana from her bed.Aroused in him sweet reverie.Arouses rustics from their sleep.Arrange without the least delayAs if impossible it wereAs if some troubled dream she dreamed.As in a thickets humble shade,As once, to fill the rapid pageAs with innumerable fires.As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,As oft to meat and drink advert,As many dinners I rehearse,As a babes slumber, or the lightAs Saadi anciently averredAs in a garden when I grew,As in the timid forest deer,As if he cruelly had joked!As storms which in chill autumn rageAs every journal now entreats,As cyphers others to appraise,As thoughts which gentle maidens have,As it were, tore himself away.As if against obstruction soreAs your light footprints on the green.As vernal storms the fields athwart.As one who bivouacs afield,As butterflies to blossoms cling.As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,As partner of my mournful days,As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,As giddy youths hilarityAs in some frenzied dream of fearAs when the tempests veil is drawnAs if it were some funeral feast.As on the rapid wings of thoughtAs rosy lips without a smile,As formerly the shepherd sitsAs bees who leave their dainty storeAs in her heart the thought sank home,As hope uncertain and as sweet,As a poetic life serene,As yet none had discovered aught;As to a worthy man and good!As if with eider-down is filled.As many entertainments be!As the sins of my youthful daysAs men who much had done that day.As formerly much agitation.As lordly mansions ought to be,As deaf and silly doth remain,As in their turn the seasons roll.As the reflection of his age,As Winter in their purity,As we lure the young gallant,As for her spouse he loved her dearly,Aside she casts her veil of gauzeAside the foes their mantles threw,Assemble from the neighbourhood:Assemblies oligarchicalAssigned a lodging, from the hallAssistance ever will extend,Assuredly should not have beenAsunder was and hate prepared?At last my father gave his blessing,At first, I clung to secrecy:At early morn returns the maidAt the front gates, but in brief spaceAt womankind he growled a curse,At home arriving he addressedAt Lrinas.Hem, that is queer!At seven in summer rose from bed,At last became a ruined man.At times three words to him addressedAt Lrinas abode producedAt Russ she was by no means cleverAt fifty who relief obtainedAt thirty who was married well,At twenty who was prig or swell,At least their accents and their wordsAt each extreme one takes his stand,At forty suffered from the gout,At times my reason almost bends,At least by show of sympathy;At a great feast against desire,At eventide would hither come,At table she was sitting byAt last the author! cries Mamma.At last is shrunk and withered quite?At his pale brow a shot to have,At morn, hand clasped in hand, they roveAt an old aunts they had arrivedAt prisoners base she never played.At first such contradictions wroughtAt morn an icy bath withinAt morn I must assuredlyAt first, but soon became inuredAt times, if only once a week,At times talk nonsense with design;At first for books was disinclined,At times to silence would resort,At this time almost understood.At eighteen not to play the fool!At neighbouring hospitalities.At the same hour she oped her eyesAte Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,Athwart the snow four paces cameAttend in male attire arrayed.Attentive be unto my rhymesAttentive to the echoing sound,Attentive listened to his speech,Attentive to the hearts first beating,Attentive listened to the lad.Attractive in its banefulness?Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,Auroras ruddy rays of lightAuthors replete with sacred fireAutocrat of the drawing-room seek?Avenge himself in proper style.Avowal then twas time to pray,Await the long-delayed caress.Awaiting on the shore I roamAwakens secret merrimentAway her golden earrings tore;Away! and cease to ring their praiseAway, Tattiana, hath been taen.Awhile this beauty captivated,Awhile sound conversation seemsAye bids ye in some way or otherBack to his regiment must roam.Baggage is heaped up in a mound,Balconies, lions heads on doors,Baptized Prascovia Pauline,Baratynski (_Feasts_)Bard of the Feasts, and mournful breast,Bard of the Finnish maiden young.Barely to draw her breath she seems,Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,Barking, young ladies osculations,Basins and jugswell! everythingBear goneshe at the threshold placed;Beats that of friends and relatives:Because she was so innocent,Because he yawned at the bare viewBecause her passion wanted art,Because a member I became.Because he could not gourmandiseBecause my lord, in battles maimed,Because in singleness of thoughtBecause I should be sure, meanwhile,Become a faithful wife and eenBecome alarmed. So never mind!Bedding is laid out and to allBefore he eighteen years attained.Before a cold indifferent crowd,Before whom once in solitude,Before him red roast beef is seenBefore the dregs they shall divineBefore her straight with roguish eyes.Before the altar, lo! the pair,Before you agonized to dieBefore a fire which feebly glowsBefore such fond simplicityBefore whose inexperienced sightBefore it ran a stream.

The LrinaVerses and tears et cetera.Bouynoff whisked off Poustiakova.To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,Each other as the shore we climb!Or for the solitary tombOpened the portals of the tombMy poor Vladimir! In the tomb,He writes upon his parents tomb,And lo! where lies a marble tombThe inmate is for ever dumb,Is the world to him sealed and dumb?And oft its Dictionary thumb.He oft upon his lips would curb,Thinking: tis foolish to disturbHe found them in an almanac,And Virtue acts as a narcotic,And triumphs in career erotic.What! really going? Tis too bad!Some are afar and some are dead.Ah! than a spectre from the deadAbove the ashes of the dead.Wheneer he had an aching head;To seek him out with bended head.Shaking with serious air the head,Now of a family the head,His shop, a night-cap on his head,And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.And gently hovered o'er my head?All silently hung down his head.And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.For patience, reader, I must plead!Or a swift hare from mead to meadBut on the third of grove and meadBut ah! discerns nor wood nor meadTis finished. Horrible to read!Thereon the passing traveller read:The first-fruits of my tale I read,That certain volumes she might read.Some nice instructive novel read,No other book had time to read.I Apuleius gladly readI slumber much, a little read,For on their brows I trembling readDo not excuse yourself. I readBut presently she tried to read;But word for word his letter read.And lessons to his children read.A little farther please to readAnd pauses oft to serve out bread.With shame I shudder and with dreadUnto a ruthless tyrant dread.And it may be a secret dreadThe pile of books, with carpet spreadNor slander viciously could spreadAnd two old pines their branches spreadFor the impatient chief instead.And cool sagacious mind he had:Although we know that Eugene hadTattiana loved as when a lad,Attentive listened to the lad.Inhabited the country, cladIn dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:But Lenski, I should be so gladHe dragged her by a forest roadHe long should have been on the road.Grant that I err not on the road.Could taste the pleasures of the road.Time flies! a genial air abroad,In love-lorn meditation sad.I was incensed and he was sad.His arm he offers. Mute and sadAn idle anchorite and sad,Still certain authors, I may add,(_Mechanically_, let us add),With book in hand reclined in bed,With hopeless passion: from her bedUndressed herself and went to bedTis time for supper, now for bed,She could not sleep in her new bed.Beneath the window-sill his bed,At seven in summer rose from bed,Aroused Tattiana from her bed.And finally, upon his bedSo she her silken sash unlaced,Upon the tumbled sofa placed,The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,Most carefully Zaretski placedIn coach or post-cart duly placedHe on his bosom gently placedExcept one by the window placedEugene in hackney carriage placed.Beneath her downy pillow placed,Bear goneshe at the threshold placed;The ancient _barshtchina_ replacedAnd exclamations interlaced.The two old ladies then embracedLay all the girls by sleep embraced,In what he merely acquiesced.To all good neighbours sport conduced.At Lrinas abode producedAll overtures of friendship ended.Most by this circumstance offendedThe workpeople she superintended,The bath on Saturdays attended,Vice had due punishment awarded,Virtue was with a bride rewarded.When to enlarge we shall succeed,Tis done. To supper they proceed.Thither in future to proceedNot all will like myself proceedIt may be that I did proceedAnd cares not farther to proceed;Will not five centuries exceedRemarkable.

Hes killed!_The channel of the river stilledOur tender dreamer had enrolledA gambling troop when he controlled,By Faublas in his youth was schooled,Surely ye all have overhauledWith blood instead of ink she scrawled,Which all her darling friends have scrawledAnd in her conversation drawled.Transparent o'er the Neva beamedThe peace which on his forehead beamed,But kindness from his eye had beamedAnd when the watery mirror gleamedThe purest of the dreams we dreamed,She never of deception dreamedHer the ideal which he dreamed,As if some troubled dream she dreamed.His elegies, which plenteous streamed,The blood gushed from the wound and steamedWhy is Tattiana guiltier deemed?Onegin was so many deemed,But one buffoon unhappy deemedA few of different temper deemed,That our desires which noblest seemed,Both natural and truthful seemed.And endless the cotillon seemedAnd to revive Tattiana seemed.Feeling in others much esteemed.A notoriety proclaimed,Because my lord, in battles maimed,When hopes delightful flower but bloomedHe thought so, and existence charmed.And he who, jealousy disarmed,How soon to habits she conformedAh! how Tattiana was transformed,To say farewell, and fussed and fumedThe manly toga scarce assumed,Only her countenance assumedTattiana in despair unfeignedWhere many another hand had signedAnd vows will probably be signed:Though, God be praised! he ne'er designedThat, for the century designed,Tall, slender, like thy form designed,Her money counted, and designedCaricatures he now designedMade revelations undesigned,To arid selfishness resigned,Spring cheered him up, and he resignedOr even, silent and resigned,Which Autumn late to earth consigned,When harsh demeanour hath consignedOnce more to idleness consigned,His lyre, to silence now consigned,Have eer a precious tress consigned,What do I ask? What cause assignedA happy destiny ordained:A valuable hostage gained,A modern Regulus unchained,Tattiana o'er the stream complained;Whose hearts responsive have remainedRooted unto the spot remained.Inseparable they remained.O ye whom tender love hath painedAnd saying this Vladimir drainedShe consolation thence obtainedAt fifty who relief obtainedA something somehow have obtained,My sum of happiness contained;He sang of life's fresh colours stainedWith us is easily attained.Hath tranquilly in turn attained,Before he eighteen years attained.The fruits of learning and combinedAnd handsome countenance combined,A tender couplet he combined,With intellect, a taste refined,His chambers close wherein confinedLove to idealize inclined;I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.At first for books was disinclined,And on the last one, underlined:Anticipating woe she pined,The venerable dame opinedCertain misfortune near opined.Now a long branch itself entwinedConstant affection intertwinedIf the fond hope I could have fannedTattiana (nurse the project planned)There, aping Gulnares bard, he spannedThough Baratynski verses penned,The date was fixed though oft postponed,The maidens weary eye which yearned,A spirit which for sorrow yearned.Tattiana more than ever burnedHis neighbours lowly tomb and mournedTo his Penates now returned,Tattiana thanks to all returned,The voice of jealousy is drowned.He on the conflagration frowned.Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.The matchmaker a fortnight sped,Our heroes at full gallop sped,Into the cups already spedOf lackeys in her pathway grouped,Thy cheek is as a poppy red!Their glory with their heels of redOf his approach; but nothing caredAn explanation: she was scared,A countenance perplexed and scared.Her features no grimaces bleared;With Olga; nor of this appearedTo an assemblyshe appearedThe tea, as I remarked, appeared,In dressing-gown at meals appeared.But in the drawing-room all appearedBut Adam Smith to read appeared,But this a heinous crime appearedAnother with cocks head appeared,And Tanias husband soon appeared.A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.A faithful model she appearedO yes! my hopes soon disappeared.My image hath not disappeared,For evermore had disappeared.Meals, secrets, occupations shared?He went notsooner was preparedAsunder was and hate prepared?I mused: perhaps the matters squaredUpon the Dons broad pastures bredQuarrels among young friends he bredBoth ducks and geese in plenty bredHomer, Theocritus, he jeered,And many another slily sneered;In her affairs ne'er interfered,Seemed in a haze of green embowered.The valleys dried and gaily flowered;His soul by crash of music fired,Extinct the flame which once had fired;By indolence and languor firedTo kiss the feet which I admired!Singing God knows what maid admired,In amorous flights when so inspired,Tis in your power now, if desired,The fated nutriment desired;How like the billow I desiredHis tea with rum no more desired,And both of dull existence tired,I write to you! Is more required?I long by ballets have been bored,An ace at fifteen paces bored.Though beauty he no more adored,Since Fame and Freedom he adored,His ruffian bravery adored,Either she saw not or ignored;Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,Contented and with victuals stored,And harmony was soon restored.Deeming himself a veteran scarredThus widely meditation erred,Tattiana through the forest erred,I long enough deceived have erred.Of the romances she preferred,And what she from the cards inferred.The Medal Otchakoff conferred!Tattiana every day conferredOf Olga he in song averred;As Saadi anciently averredWhilst from her countenance ne'er stirredIn the recesses what hath stirredAnd by a genuine sorrow stirred,And by a partial temper stirredSit many monstrous shapes abhorred.Onguines speeches I abhorredHe who economy abhorred,What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?Of censure for the same incurred;The poet from Tamboff secured,Till proper rings could be procured.Now Didelot scarce can be endured!At first, but soon became inuredOn melted wax in water poured;Odes Lenski also had outpoured,In fact, some people were assuredRebuffedas quickly reassured,A marriageable maid matured,The shining pistols are uncased,Till the fire in her cheek decreased;More timid than a doe long chased,The contact of the foot I raisedAnd leaning gainst the portal closedYou, he a noble mind disclosed,On chairs in the saloon reposed,To her an elegy composed.Though some men, evilly disposed,And Flinoff, somewhat indisposed,Lenski that eve in thought immersed,In love adventures she was versed,But he who by the Muse was nursedOr, it may be, the bard had passedAlas! for now before her passedWhen Friendship smiled or Love caressed.The style in which my hero dressed;At times three words to him addressedAt home arriving he addressedAnd when I prayer to Heaven addressedReplaced them in their box, undressedWhen all around the entrance pressed,Bullets are down the barrels pressed,What ails thee, dear?I feel depressed.But sits in bed with air depressed,The image of her seal impressed.Onegin was the most impressed,Are not with elegance impressed.And kindness Tania was impressed,And thoughts of Olga first impressedThe strange apartment her oppressed:Ever by adverse fate oppressed,Is it not truth? in tones suppressedKnow that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,Wherein the heart its vows expressed,So she in French herself expressed.Not agony, but death expressed.How much is in that word expressed!Then weeping she sank back distressedBut once more pensive and distressedA deadly pallor, air distressed;The maid whose note he still possessedNor enough strength of mind possessedBut tremor still her frame possessed,If the poor maiden could have guessedWithin that secret court discussed,The room my former master used.Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.That rascal Lovelace she abused;By friendship how they were abused,The hussar Pykhtin was accused.No signs of trouble her accused,Nought in the universe refused:Bouynoff courted. She refused.And though her soul might be confused,Some Russian authors he perusedNot that she had his works perused,A book at early morn perused.In fact, the subject analysed,Even so! His passions soon abated,They sang, whilst negligently seated,He ought to have conciliatedBy daily life deteriorated,He might his motives have narrated,Her inmost soul had penetrated,Nor long his mind was agitatedAwhile this beauty captivated,Were to analysis subjected.Hath she a fitting phrase selected?And life and fate in turn selectedThey long at home have her expectedTattiana with impatience waitedHis visit she had not awaited,A bastard fame prohibited?Vladimir Lenski visitedHow the young imp on Tania doted!To captivate her how devoted!By Olgas hand distributedAnd every year distributedOf what he thought and what believed,All mothers their sweet girls believedAnd she at last hath us deceived;Lenski as a good match received,In vain was youth by us received,Upon those margins she perceivedRetained the image, though short-lived,The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:At an old aunts they had arrivedA new proprietor arrived,The fatal tubes Lepage contrivedWhich afterwards the muse revived.The conversation was revivedWho had for four long years survivedTurned and replied as it behoved,When but a boy he Olga lovedAnd ditties of the steppe she loved.Perceived that he was still beloved,Onegin, by first impulse moved,He witnessed tenderly and movedAlready by repentance movedAnd as a country damsel roved,Strictly the Carnival observed,For first madame his wants observed,And ancient usages observedAnd these the attentive maid observed(For which our praise he hath deserved).Her bow was easy, unreserved.They in a peaceful life preservedBut Eugene was by fate preserved,But proudly in his song preservedAnd numerous pages had preservedA mien unaltered she preserved,The gifted songster never swerved,Journeys and warriors to wed.And when her violence reviewedThe breath of Spring again renewed,Simple and kindly and unwed,Without the least constraint he bowed.Who to the youthful hostess bowed,In company, or simply bowed,Till amid trees a hovel showed,Onegin ne'er as poet showedHe gazed upon the clock which showedEt cetera_; but nothing showedA scant attendance Lenski showedBut from the interview what flowed?The insensate fire of love still glowedPassions wild sway I then allowed,In correspondence been allowed.He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,Enraptured was he if allowedAnd necessary fools allowed.And privileges nice allowed,Having a trusty staff bestowed,Please her by their decorum fixed,Titles and ages intermixed.The drama of my youth was played.The deuce with my inside has played.He with his little maiden played,Eight rubbers were already played,At prisoners base she never played.Without amaze or wrath displayed:Meadows and cornfields are displayed,In Olgas face no life's displayed.With bitter tears my mother prayed,Attend in male attire arrayed.And when for Olga nurse arrayedThat we her constantly betrayedThus carelessly I once portrayedChange of position had essayed,There long time sad at heart he stayed:Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.Yet was her inmost soul oerjoyedUpon a soul inert and cloyed?Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,Of course Tattiana was annoyedAnd is all light within destroyed?What is your name? The boor looked dazed,She on the apparition gazed,Again imagination blazed,And vehemently though amazedAnd Agathon replied, amazed.Whom hath thy strain immortalized?Which Ovid once immortalized,With tenderness hath recognizedFor which the poet agonizedIn much his conduct stigmatized;And long perukes hath vanishd.Tattiana doth accept his aid;Her Martin Zadeka in aid,The powder in the pan is laid,He found him on the table laid,And many a day thereafter laidAnd her upon the threshold laid.Singing inside her hut the maidShould go, the market for a maid,She comprehends. The simple maidRemained with him the youthful maid.Of a young dark-eyed country maid,My pretty self-deceiving maidMine own ideal, the mountain maid,In Olgas album, youthful maid,For shame lift up the modest maid.Beneath her parents eyes the maidAt early morn returns the maidAnd, hanging down her head, the maidAnd crossed with trembling hand the maid.And for Tattiana, mournful maid,Alone with my Venetian maid,A load of care upon the maid.To classicism I've homage paid,Nor frigid adulation paid.A due which must to earth be paid.Fortune the poet had repaid.That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,She, to turn back her eyes afraid,No time to pick it up! afraid,With many a vacancy, tis said.What they in conversation said?Vladimir something curtly saidThough scarcely following what was said,Poor Yorick, mournfully he said,Onegin then approached and said:In whispers low the neighbours said:Gazing into his face, she said:But finally she softly said:And the old nurse a brief prayer saidAdieu she to the matron saidAnd spectacles, his knitting staidSo be it! Just the laws which bidBetter than Chateaubriand didA ball he fell as Tchatzki did.In mist profound all yet is hid.Had rendered him an invalid;Returning, from his ship amidWherefore am I your quarry held?She dreamt she journeyed o'er a fieldAnd thus in season the rich fieldScornfully challenged you afieldAs one who bivouacs afield,What are they? Gladly would I yieldInto thy hands my fate I yield!Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.What can be done? She is no child!And can it be? But late a childAn ardent heart and yet so mild?With an imagination wild,And now a fickle flirt and wild,We never loved in days of old,These evenings as in days of oldTattiana in traditions oldI also wandered there of old,He took the room wherein the oldBut that Princess Pauline of old,And the suspicious veteran old,And Limburg cheese alive and oldAn almanac but eight years old.Zaretski, once a bully bold,Werther, rebellious martyr bold,The wolf upon the highways boldThe morn arises foggy, cold,He laughs, although it aches from cold,But cannot stand the northern cold.Blank, unapproachable and cold.And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.His housekeeper was wont to scold,His mother from the door doth scold.How empires store of wealth unfold,The medium is required of gold.Is seen next pine-apples of gold.Afar, where clothed in green and goldSome marriageable maids behold,In one he doth accounts behold,Before it ran a stream. Behold!Alas! she is as hard, behold,Her Moscow cousin, often toldHad killed me had the like been told.And the young ladies fortunes told,In dreams and what the moon foretoldThe Great WorldA journey to Moscow!

Why is he there?It may be ye were born, or thereI promised!Did I so?Well, there!And yet the citys flower was there,And Eugene soon discovered thereAnd lo! he is already there!Alone the princess sitteth there,Was born beside the Neva, whereHe bends his course to Talons, whereFaces which we meet everywhereJust as he entered. How severe!I yield the fruit of work severe.And be not in advance severe.Still sovereigns of his spirit were,If the choice in my power were,As if impossible it wereAnd dark and drear the evenings were,Our misanthrope was full of ire,Would haste in agitation direOlga with trepidation dire.Oblivion of life's tempest dire,Their privileged allurements fireThe proud ones are not worth the fireStood as if struck by lightning fire.Or bosom full of languid fire,Nor sparkled with poetic fire,For our Automedons are fireAuthors replete with sacred fireAnd spouted it with lyric fireYet still apparently aspireWith our Onegin doth aspireFoeman or friend, I do aspireWhose tones Apollos sons inspire,Nor wit, nor did the same inspireLike D when dinner doth inspire.He deemed his coming would inspireAnd that no longer could inspire.Which glowed with virginal desire.To mutter her concealed desireThis world. I do not praise desire,So ardently did I desireSlowly exhausted by desire,Raged round him and of balked desire!He felt the laudable desireBut Lenski, having no desireAt a great feast against desire,All that a poet could desire,All that perfection could desire;Adieu! whateer thou didst desireA hidden train of wild desire.His constant soul could ever tire,And our swift troikas never tire;The wit of others to acquire.Within his mind Tattiana bore,Within my memory I boreWith thee I conversed when I boreOpened with care, and entering boreNow buffoon, glutton, and a bore.And brooding o'er the ills he bore,Tattiana, Russian to the core,Or, as it were, the Freischutz scoreWhom thirty centuries adore.Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?The Russian winter did adoreThoult suffer, dearest, but before,My spirit with such pangs before.He read as vainly as before,He was deceived. Just as beforeAnd the young girl appeared beforeThey stir the heart as heretofore.To help her to the other shoreTis time to quit this weary shoreThe captives of the Salguirs shore.Or by the oceans rocky shore.Of the imperial Nevas shore.How oft to the Crimean shoreAnd thy protection I implore.With affectation,nothing more.With it may be a couple more;Society renounced once more.Where Nereids murmur evermore,As if against obstruction soreAway her golden earrings tore;And homeward like an arrow tore.A gust of passion never toreEndowing us from out her storeAs bees who leave their dainty storeNow the sweet little shoes she wore,Bouynoff too, my cousin, woreWho would have thought it? As of yore!Rogue and extortioner of yore,But which, my dear?In days of yoreAs thou, great Homer, didst of yore,A fragile bridge and insecure,Hath gradually learnt to endure;For who imposture can endure,But competition I abjureBut deeming all this nonsense pure,Sit down. How funny, to be sure!He will delight you, I am sure,For longfor ever. To be sureThen my companions young with pleasureIn history he took no pleasure,Found out the secret how at pleasureYet still of anecdotes a treasureIn the unfettered hours of leisureAnd then she soon twixt work and leisureThat my dishonour would ensureSerious endeavours to assureHappy who timely grew mature,For ever with thy tattling lyre,And after Albions proud lyreYe need dissimulation baseFelled a calumniator base!That a friends arm in every caseFor my wild garden and bookcase,Who tyrannizes us with ease,Though he surveyed her at his ease,Glides with a more luxurious ease;But Tanias heart is not at ease,Still the loud stamping doth not cease,With childlike lisp will lie to please.The journey in a sledge doth please,Possession hath no power to please,Napoleon tarried till it pleaseCan I inspect the mansion, please?O epic Muse, my powers increaseTo cool the cutlets seething grease,Of modern Russians the disease.If seriously he hath disease;A very troublesome disease,The curs away to kennel chase,Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.In motley and amusing chase.Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.Who every gesture, every phraseTo russify the foreign phraseNot even a poetic phrase,Moscow! How much is in the phraseI say without poetic phrase,Handbook of fashionable phraseAddress to you one single phraseIt matters not. Hope een to theseFrom careless stanzas such as these,Eugene would speak regarding these.She would pronounce _ la Franaise_;The curtain now they slowly raise.She mourned and to the moon would raiseOf passion they so often raise.How sweet a dream your memories raise!And in her languid bosom raiseAnd where the billows hoarsely raiseTo God eternal hymns of praise.Away! and cease to ring their praiseAs cyphers others to appraise,Because he could not gourmandiseThey growl a bitthey scandaliseTired by the balls incessant noise,Engrave the ice with strident noise.Crushing and a confusing noise;But at her shriek ran forth with noiseCould in a humble sphere despise,Yet sometimes banished hopes will riseWhen Eugene like a ghost did riseThe shopman and the pedlar riseThe crowd doth head and shoulders riseOft upon friendly lips doth rise:Late in the afternoon to rise,In column blue the smoke doth rise;A blood-bespattered shade would rise,Where melancholy rocks ariseThus thou, Yazykoff, dost ariseThose hellish phantoms. Peals ariseOf the night sentinels ariseMiraculously fair arise,And would by candlelight arise.The Lrinas were since sunriseHe has returned, say in what guise?Olga the tea must superviseThe chief of the Chaldean wise,Manforty years long in this wiseIs he the same or grown more wise?He is a charming youth and wise.But now a question in this wiseOlga began to long likewiseWith his exasperated sense,Reduced with effort unto sense,Pervaded with much common sense.May be the empire of the sense,He well-nigh lost the use of sense,And I admired their common senseWe hear with interest intenseThough now my love might be intense,Inspired but weariness intense;The windows whitened, shutters closeLadies in crowds around her close,Phials of crystal scents enclose.Malignant fury they disclose,A curious interest discloseCommand me, darling, what you chooseWhen, wise at length, we seek reposeHer smile and maidenly repose,Do agitate his late repose.Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,But better loved the soft reposeBut nowhere can she find repose,And where at last his bones reposeAlready crisp hoar frosts imposeYears to light rhyme themselves oppose,Of thankless friends the circle rose,Furious he from the table rose;(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,He enters. High the cork aroseAnd the conviction soon arose,Years have inclined me to stern prose,As many dinners I rehearse,Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,Too much I'm given to intersperse,They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,That for that matter in my verseAnd also that my feeble verseAlthough we read him heaps of verse.Or ice and flame, are not diverseRound which revolves the universe.Within his sledge the stiffened corse,The speech of man and tramp of horse.Most usually a Cossack horseLoud paws the earth each panting horse,Detecting him the passing horseDeparted, ordered out his horseA fiery, yet well-broken horse,In age the memory gets worse,Existence would not make a curse,At womankind he growled a curse,How dull you are this morning, nurse!Snorts, and his rider bends his courseOh, many a year hath run its courseAll visited him at first, of course;A dinner, whimsical each course,Of friends the grateful intercourseYe mothers also, caution use,One instrument for his own useI once forgot for your sweet causeI lift a warning voice becauseThe thirst for fame and mans applause,Whose memory doth not refuseThe foaming Lenski would refuse,Now I am ready to refuse.But look youah! do not refuse.With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,Poetic transport did infuse,Ideas, desires and woes confuseThe monsters of the British MuseNow for the first time I my MuseIncited by his stormy MuseBut I the products of my Muse,But I must now employ my MuseAdmirer of the peaceful Muse,A mournful temper on his Muse.What can be drearier than the house,Then became busy with the house,Received him freely at her house,Now, as in a deserted house,So hearken, every worthy spouse,Night separated from her spouse,Deplores a most unworthy spouseBesides the hobbies of a spouseThe drum already doth arouse.I would your vigilance arouse,To my old nurse alone peruse,Her steppe-like beauties I peruseConfess, O ye who this peruse,But what results? His eyes peruseBut Olga would not such peruse.They would not solemnly debateThey long ago had held debate.My famous portrait indicateBut this amusement delicateI marriednow, I supplicateTold me to ask you.

The world replies,Ever to hear the same repliesAll breathless and without replies.Luceria Lvovna paint applies,His friends and also enemiesHad come both friends and enemiesThe general who accompanies.And the bad book accompanies.To bear loves parching agoniesThrice happy who their agoniesOh! who her speechless agoniesAlarmed by jealous agonies:Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg piesShe from the winter corn espiesSome a mazurka occupies,Tis silent all! Alone the criesHe roars, and Ah! Tattiana cries.Upon those pages she descriesEven the rosy wafer driesPast palaces and nunneries,In the worlds mortal revelries,With raspberries, cherries.And pelt him with cherries,To peer into the future tries.And alphabetically triesTo watch with lovers ecstasies,From public and from private ties,My splendid house and gaietiesThan cold Onguines oddities,At neighbouring hospitalities.And fashions gay frivolities;The gilding of life's vanities,I yield for splendid vanities,Who glory, wealth and dignitiesSpared him not their asperities.The country hath its libertiesUpon her tongue which fever bakes.And in her grasp the letter shakes,Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,The doors swing open: Lenski makesThe guests make room; aside each takesHe now a full possession takes,Without grammatical mistakes.The third at night. Tattiana wakesMay be, and this my terror wakes,The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,Or else (I deal not here in jokes),His recent glory he invokes.Also, to equalise the scales,Time, I invoke thee! favouring galesShe got a book of nursery tales,The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,Tis not so now. Like gentle damesEnclosing pictures of fair dames.But lights incendiary flamesAnd the dark fringe of men, like framesAnd jolting jarred the window-frames.To banish far unworthy themesTo whom ye for unnumbered crimesI sail upon my lake at timesAnd the young revellers of past timesAlas! he loved as in our timesAnd due precautions take betimes.And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,Whom pale Dianas ray illumesThe fishers fire afar illumesMad spirit of the man who rhymesHad to compose in secret rhymes,Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,Beside the cup she sang her rhymesAttentive be unto my rhymesBeneath the moon which dimly shines,And an enchanting shoulder shinesHer head upon her breast declinesUpon her elbow she reclines,Longer the East inert reclinesUpward in a thin stream inclines.Wherein love innocently pines.The golden ember now enshrines,And fashionable magazines,Arouse yourselves, fair ones.Yes! every one must have his foes,Now, like hereditary foes,And now he views forgotten foes,Winter! The peasant blithely goesStraight from the ball to bed he goes,Into the tangled garden goesEsteemed him much as the world goes.And meditative homeward goes,All arise. To the door he goes.All vanished as an echo goes.Between the stalls, along the toes;The accents wild of others woes,But nought for this Tattiana cares.With hisses Cleopatra scares,He fixedly upon her staresThe husband comes and interferesThe wondrous host of heavenly spheresAnd thus ancestral dust reveres.Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,Imaginations sacred fires,As with innumerable fires.And youthful madness, youthful fires.And still the coachmen round the firesWhite Moscow raises her old spires,Forgive the fever youth inspires,Compassion now or wrath inspiresAnd where tempestuous loves desires,And now his youthful heart desiresAnd of the irksome harness tires,Jackdaws on every spirein scores.Seated, a curious look with glassesShouts of applause! Onegin passesIn true interpretation hates:And slowly life coagulatesWhich in your spirit dominates,Nor in his dreams anticipatesBut wretched who anticipates,Cards, balls, routs, poetry or ftes;A trouble fell upon the sprites;_Quecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,And what like menaces fatigues,Which shines with iridescent hues.Her bosom heaves whilst crimson huesBy poor Tattiana in the blues;For ever carps, condemns, pursues?A victim decked with golden leaves;All which caprice and affluence craves,Across the Baltics salt sea waves,Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,And pallid nature trembling grieves,Who dressing-gown and slippers givesDescends, the order Guillot gives,Thus our light race grows up and lives,He enters: to the mill he drives:The appointed hour arrives, arrives!He rings in haste; in haste arrivesBeats that of friends and relatives:Our liberty at least survives:She the acquaintances she loves,To the pianoforte he movesHer spacious fields and shady groves,And various chords upon it proves,Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,Where every day before his eyesTo dreams I long have closed mine eyes,Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,Sudden she stops, casts down her eyesOlga he sees before his eyesOf frantic laughter, and all eyesNot daring to cast back her eyes.For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,But finally he oped his eyesBut wide Tattiana oped her eyesBefore her straight with roguish eyes.At the same hour she oped her eyesAnd truffles, dear to youthful eyes,His travels like all other thingsFor tallow, wood and other things_The peasants there are rich as kings,But still remembrance to him clings,Disperse yourselves, darlings,Happy and glorious_. But this bringsAll this in many cases bringsAll that industrial London bringsBrilliant, ethereal, there springsAnd now she skips and now she springsObedient to the magic strings,With late repentance gnaws and stings.Slow circling round its fellow swingsThe time between the wolf and dogsHow pleasantly the evening jogsSecret excursions made in sleighs;Along the Nevas bank he sleighs,Tattiana moans and now she sighsGoddess of lovers tender sighs.Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!Exceptionless as no rule is,And deem the world perfection is!Calmly her eyes encounter hisEugene, more tolerant than thisI just hint, in parenthesis,If ye but knew how dreadful tisWho with the Spanish envoy speaks?Lo, the ambassador who speaksBut yet Terpsichore bespeaksBetimes, and sees, when morning breaks,The old man who has had his freaks,Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,Go hear the rustling of the oaksHowever, the mazurka lacksFor the first time the hammer clicks.And terrify a swarm of ducks,Dianas bosom, Floras cheeks,The princes eye Onegin seeks:He who hath lived and living, thinks,He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinksA horses hoofs she hearsShe shrinks!In the meantime her spirit sinks,But nowmy very blood congeals,Was the meek love a maiden feels.Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compelsMay yet be studious of his nails;And beckon to the passing sails.Custom the despot soon prevails.The early tinkling of the bellsWhich of approaching labour tellsWhen the sonorous Brguet tellsPast women, sentry-boxes, rolls,Impelled by Springs dissolving beams,Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.To agitate me in my dreams.Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,He perished. Where his troubled dreams,For rural solitude and dreams,Do we foresee in troubled dreamsAnd where Thalia softly dreamsAnd the hearts agitated dreams.Descended swift in turbid streamsAnd where the admirable streamsThis wicked, that absurd he deems,This nonsense, that dishonest seems,Their memory lingers still and seemsBarely to draw her breath she seems,Awhile sound conversation seemsAnd heedless of approval seems,Or, when anew all Nature teems,Glory with which our history teemsAnd more imagination teems.Of conversation, thought and aimsWhere harsh frivolity proclaimsNo gift she bears, no feast proclaims,When evening o'er the landscape looms,In Olgas and Tattianas roomsA windmill too a jig performsAnd wildly waves its arms and storms;In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.Doctors and women, sobs and groans.Young maidens, fair maidens,The secrets of maidens.The frolics of maidens.Disport yourselves, maidens,Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,Insensible her hand remainsHis kneeling posture he retainsTo secrets of virgins,Friends and companions,Barking, young ladies osculations,Priams of country populationsAnd dames of fine organisations,Old peoples simple conversationsTheir offsprings innocent flirtationsLatest arrivals salutations,They were the wonderful traditionsProphecies, threats and apparitions,Had finished life amid his sons,For baseness of the spirit scorns,With blunted pencil-point adorns.Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,With flame more ardent passion burns,Her heart importunately turns.But to Onegin! _A propos!_All covered up with snow in heaps,Its stamping, capers and high leaps.In country towns, where still it keepsTis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.A little virgin mirror peeps.And lonely through the forest creeps.I will not wed, and ever weepsThe house is crammed. A thousand lampsImpatiently the gallery stamps,Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,Behold! beside their dwelling groupsWithout participation hears,With smiling face he Lenski hears;The two friends compliments she hearsThe silent fields no peasant nears,Although the destined coffin nears,With his ferocious mate appears.Tattiana in the yard appearsShe calm and unconcerned appears.Nearer they comeEugene appears!Mournful Loves deadly trace appearsFaithless, alas! thy maid appears,Distracted by her grief appearsAnd what from its recess appears?All in the good old style appears,The aged mother, bathed in tears,Not, and a flood of bitter tearsMy poor Vladimir, bitter tearsLikewise an epitaph with tearsHer weary eyes are filled with tearsHer sacred hoard of joy and tears,And to these letters and these tears.Her cap of tulle still ever wears:With Eugene pranks of former yearsThe solstice of our earthly years,(So twas with us in former years,For dolls, een from her earliest years,For visions of my childish yearsPortmanteaus and preserves in jars,Have shone as one of fashions leaders.Onegin, O my gentle readers,Should recompense his idle jeers,But foolstheir calumnies and sneersOld age through spectacles too peers,The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,And judgment which unsteady veersTattiana certainly infersThe hamlet, the poor villagers,She ne'er repeated unto hers.If his hot hand encountered hers,Her garden, and those books of hers,Epicurean philosophers,Boulevards, belfries, milliners,Nor almanacs nor newspapers,Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepersSpring summons you to her green bowers,Youth freshens beneath Passions showers,Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;Of Levshins school ye followers,Develops and matures its powers,Nor boston nor the worlds affairsSaucepans and mattresses and chairs,To the theatre he repairsHe to the festival repairs,Tis day, the family downstairs,But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,A moment effervescing stirs,Balconies, lions heads on doors,And hated casual visitors,And the kind-hearted servitors:With one paw strokes her face and purrs,And where a madrigal occursTo swathe her shoulders in the furs,Judge then what roses would be ours,I see you weep. Those tears of yoursDreaming of what not, pretty lass,The manners of the highest classAnd breathes upon the chilly glass,Would loiter by the looking-glass,By bee and butterfly which pass.Both day and night he now must passAnd lo! five paces more they pass,And from his dressing-room would passUnseen in thick and tangled grassDivinity without accessYet satiated with success,There was no angling for success.In the worlds vortex my success,Trembling he seeks the young princessTattiana in the young princess!But the indifferent princess,Thus oftthis I myself confessEntreaties, woes and prayers, confessAnd now, I mournfully confess,How flourish, why and wherefore lessMe your perfections would not bless;If the domestic hearth could blessAlso their feetyet neerthelessWith fir-trees standing motionlessSpeech was so tame and colourlessWas famous for thick-headedness.To loiter there in idlenessMen become friends from idleness.Love, flowers, the country, idlenessHer heart how full of gentleness,A child devoid of childishnessTattiana finds in loneliness.In melancholy loveliness,Her cheek of rosy lovelinessAnd contemplative dreaminess;Twas possible then, happinessOr, strange to me is happiness?Oppressive now is happiness,He _cannot_ give me happiness.By Heaven in lieu of happiness.But strange am I to happiness;With laughter smothered weariness:Their slander een was weariness;In old age life is weariness!And freezing fits of weariness.All sons of mental weariness.This glitter, riot, emptiness,Amid the awful emptinessIn rhyming I show laziness.Attractive in its banefulness?I murmur not! Why mournfulness?I thank thee for thy joyfulness,Where my days in the wildernessWith spiritual tenderness;Inspired by whom this tenderness,Aroused in him some tenderness.The bays of age and helplessness.My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessnessIs it that human restlessnessOnegin, all this sumptuousness,Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?Whose hands indulgently caressThose whom we ought to love, caress,Await the long-delayed caress.To array himself in evening dress.The ladies, their fantastic dress,Or kiss the border of her dress.Nor dares the skirting of her dressMeantime in matutinal dressHer eyes no saucy glance address,Conquer by passion and address,She hears the bear behind her press,Her feet the earth beneath her press!But Eugene long hath left the pressA young Armidas lips to press,Wherefore regarding him expressTo fawn upon and love express;She starts, nor doth a word express,I like the difference to expressAll that the heart would fain expressDally with a dishevelled tressNor discontinued to distressLoves tender transports and distress,Inflict annoyance and distressHymens embarrassments, distress,Her agitation and distressHabit was given us in distressAnd though I read it with distress,Tattianas letter I possess,If wife and children to possessIf the raw product they possessA strong resemblance these possessThis gentle daring who could guess?Her nurse, who could have made a guess,Could not in that brief moment guess!Alas! It is not hard to guess.The uncontaminated kissHave felt loves agitated kissBeneath his lips devouring kiss.A ladys hand doth never kiss.With tears, confused emotions, bliss,This evanescent boyish bliss.Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,In thee, thou world of empty bliss.Even amusing fools we missBut how? Quite so. Though I dismissCan count the time without much fussBeside the thundering abyssEverywhere trumpeting its feats,Again the giddy waltz repeats.As every journal now entreats,Soon the maid on a chair he seats,And stay whose length none recollects.In the meantime the mill inspects.Their coming which no man expects,Leaning against the dam expects,Of slumbering citizens he fleets,Whom latterly one often meetsThough without palaces and streets,Past darkened windows and long streetsAlong Saint Petersburgs paved streets,Not seeking love but sensual sweets.Delicious visions, jests and fights!Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,The fire of the nocturnal lights;And oh! what verses, what delights,Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,With rapturous longing he awaits,Will teach grammatical conceits,As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,And his poor basten sandal knits.The maiden at her casement sitsAs formerly the shepherd sitsWith cherries, red currants,Its splendour and its blandishments,But, after mutual compliments,The epistle from the bard presents.She visited the humble tentsThe hours once more Onegin counts,But ten strikes and his sledge he mountsA rivulet beneath them shootsTwo pines have joined their tangled roots,To Olga Petoushkova darts:Ever receive with kindly heartsThe flimsy wares of Western marts,We Russians, friends from distant partsThe Paris of those country partsMeantime a Cyclops of those partsBaratynski (_Feasts_)Deliberate approach of guestsVariety of speech and vests,Who labours hard to humour us?Well! Lrina appears to usUs, and like Trojan warriors slay us;The stomach doth admonish us.And like Napoleons each of usThough for his Helen MenelausA million bipeds reckons thusCorneilles majestic genius,Whereto in language courteousYea! although rendered beauteousAnd gloomy epigrams malicious.A critic of the stage malicious,A slave of actresses capricious,To witticisms and taunts half-viciousThe conversation tediousOh! who is not calumnious?There Didelot became glorious,She seemed of him oblivious,By such allusions scandalous,With satisfaction marvellous,By Tolstoys pencil marvellous,And tiresome rogues ridiculousHow mean, how pusillanimous!Amid sly, pusillanimousThe drive becomes monotonousFeeling is silly, dangerous.Thou also, reader generous,Then ye were barely generous,It was a cheery, generousHe shunned those parties boisterous;Abandon cities riotous,Come sing we in chorusThe friend of liberty and lawsI long have ceased to offend the laws.Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,The tightened leathern rein she draws,Perverse, unfavourable views?His watch, the sun in turn he viewsAnd through the lofty windows viewsTo male acquaintances he bows,The men salute with lower bowsWith all dissatisfaction shows.The epitaph on marble shows:Misunderstanding, words and blows.Mends with the Russian hammers blowsAnd Comet champagne foaming flows.When Passions fire no longer glowsBefore a fire which feebly glowsAmber on pipes from Stamboul glows,And this the faithful one allows,Profiles of lovely dames he knowsFor otherwiseGod only knows!And all the joys which Winter knows.Upon the dreary northern snows,The first appearance of the snowsHis pony sniffing the fresh snowsThrough dense aristocratic rowsFrom boxes or from stalls in rows.The connoisseur his glances throwsOn unknown female forms he throws.Oer hillock and o'er meadow throws.Enjoy the meed which Fame bestowsWe called to mind our youthful daysTo vary for a few brief days.The very morning of our days.That vanished are my youthful daysOf fiery youths untutored daysO triumphs of my guileless days,Moscow, how oft in evil days,Companion of my childhoods days.As the sins of my youthful daysAs partner of my mournful days,And then to meditate for daysAlas! the friend of childish daysBut even thus not now-a-days!And I confess that now-a-daysOr Bogdanovitchs sweet lays.In one of thine enchanting laysConsisting of harmonious lays,Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,On the blue blocks of ice the raysNo more with pale Dianas rays,Her hand for the cotillon prays.With which blind Fortune oft betraysNor interest in aught betrays.Alas! my stomach it betraysWhen he in ardent verse portraysOnegin his excuses says;Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;Till the mazurkas close he stays,Streams excavate subaqueous ways,Or parody of modern ways?Delighted much his former waysBut soon she altered all her ways,And hates the worlds discordant ways.Unto Anicia for the keysThe household troop of little boys,A joyous troop of little boysWho cannot conjure former joys?Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,Approach not to gaze atUnless forbidden fruit we eat,She gazed thereon, and instant beatEre this but one brief moment beatThere the confusion, pressure, heat,And boiling o'er with friendly heat,Age immature averse to cheatNurses who scream and babes who bleat.With lovers rubbish filled, was neatWhich lessons unto us repeat,The passionate speeches I'll repeat,Now all things round about repeatI mean my name not to repeat.I might to connoisseurs repeatDo not cold-bloodedly repeatAnd in a whisper did repeat:A hundred times will not repeat,And cry: he was a poet great!And at economy was great;Alone amid possessions great,A ball here, there a childrens treat,When in the studys calm retreat,On this artistical retreatOf woods and fields the calm retreat,Till out of breath upon a seatRemoved her to his country seat,Happy who quit life's banquet seatAbandoned he his country seat,No misery I see in thatBegins to talk of this and that,Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,Upon my lake I love to float,But when two minutes she had sat,My friend, tis but to pay a debt,Her brow she did not een contractAnd blush to own himself reflect.With so much warmth and intellect?Of keen sarcastic intellectWhere I can no more recollect?Two verses he could recollectThe perfidies I recollectSo prudent, and so circumspectShould make me much more circumspect,The glass unwittingly inspectSuch am I. This did ye expect,And Christian folk will, I expect,An inn at every stage erect.The disenchanted glass directSo full of piety, correct,Of the neid, but incorrect.Herein my portrait should detect,Faithfully shall I now depict,Wherein the child of fashion strictYoung ladies faces and their feet.Three pairs of handsome female feet;Long ago, prostrate at her feet.Eugene fell prostrate at her feetBut nowwhat brings you to my feet?Bows and the scrape of many feet,Are oft deceptivelike their feet.And rapid whirl of many feet,A heavy goose on scarlet feet,Her heart more loudly and more fleet.Where fashionable circles meetThe miserable bard to meet,The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,O Brenta, once more we shall meetAnd watch her eyes full glance to meet.Your magic voices I shall greet,Her with a smile old women greet,But staggers, slips, and falls. We greetNear Kharitons in a side streetTo whom is it to go, my sweet?The words and looks of charmers sweetThat heart with inspiration sweetThat my coy Muse might sing more sweet.Our paradise is no more sweet.Look quickly to your left, my sweet!Ceaselessly to the maiden sweetAs hope uncertain and as sweet,And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;Wherein I castigation get;But time flies and she doth forgetAh! I still struggle to forgetBeside a nameless rivulet,And by that shady rivuletWithout enthusiasm he metWhere God alone knows whom she met.When in her walks abroad she metThe hour whenFate so willedwe metOf one thing till again we met.Then in the silent cabinetOf widow Clicquot or MoetThy dove, thy darling little petThe landscape which the moonbeams fret,Tortured by pangs of wild regret,The fair, nor parted with regret,My friends, the poet ye regret!On whom a sisters heart was setOf every sort and every set!Ere the bright messenger had set.And wean unattractive setA simple tombstone hath been set.It will be by a mob besetWhilst on the floor Monsieur TriquetWhere in the country Eugene yet,Onegin, hast forgotten yetMid worldly pleasures chased him yet,Hath she found out the riddle yet?For twice you came to them and yetThen amongst strangers I was leftWell nigh her heart in twain was cleft.Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,Of consolation all bereftWho secretly denounced the gift,Though deep he sinks into the drift;Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,Raises within my breast as oftAnd by the world repeated oft,Born of a babbler in a loftSpeech careless, incorrect, but soft,But from the Muses loftiest heightIn vehicles surcharged with freight;And hurried home his awful freight.China and bronze the tables weight,To many a noisy feast and fight,That, tipsy once in actual fight,In bullets, sabres, and in fight.I with my friend intend to fight!Eight times the heroes of the fightCartel, or challenge to a fight,Above the yawning grave would fight,Yet clearer shines than every lightWas withered ere the morning lightWas younger than myself, my light,There came a sudden flash of light,The firmament in mellow light,The ladies dresses airy, light,The crowd and merriment and light,That the two friends with mornings lightPour on this orb a dazzling lightOr but for fame he saw the light;Of sunset glow with rosy light,Like Hippocrene it scatters light,Could not eclipse her neighbours light.By liberties or loose or light.But lo! already the moons lightBut wilful, frivolous, and light.Blest be the labours of the light,Auroras ruddy rays of lightAs a babes slumber, or the lightArising with the mornings light,And showed with an uncertain lightAll about Olgato a lightOur hero stops and doth alight,_Who in thy love finds more delightWhen tea was brought.

Now, tis my intentSo Tania to her hearts contentFirst reconciled and then content;But was our friend Eugene content,And with his lot in life content,And scanned in silence its content.In course of time (the whole extentTime was, in style magniloquentTis time she to the altar went!The Lrinas unwisely went,Remained unnoticed. Once he wentPerused, Eugene in postchaise wentOnegin to the window wentNot so!
