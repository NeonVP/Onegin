But Eugene,And though I read it with distress,And where tempestuous loves desires,And privileges nice allowed,And hates the worlds discordant ways.And turned to leave immediately,And town and friends forgotten quite.And where the admirable streamsAnd with his lot in life content,And by a genuine sorrow stirred,And stay whose length none recollects.And such unconsciously he led,And crossed with trembling hand the maid.And homeward like an arrow tore.And solitude and calm delight.And the old nurse a brief prayer saidAnd would by candlelight arise.And hurried home his awful freight.And she to whom my lyre would fain,And the cast-iron statuetteAnd scanned in silence its content.And Moscow many a beauty fair:And hated casual visitors,And vanish like a bird in air.And the attendants called in haste.And ringing wine-glasses are plied.And glasses unemployed all night;And breathe the balmy breath of night;And calmly sleeps the hours away,And they the waters recommend.And in her languid bosom raiseAnd the kind-hearted servitors:And with remorseful anguish filled,And chattering loud sit down to dine.And rapid whirl of many feet,And then a cup of coffee drank,And grant his weary bones their restAnd thoughtlessness to woe might lead.And slowly life coagulatesAnd distance interposed in vain,And an habitual sense of pain;And clad in airy costume tookAnd fields my joys have ever been;And lessons to his children read.And gradually day unfolds.And heedless of approval seems,And where Thalia softly dreamsAnd like a shadow haunted her.And pauses oft to serve out bread.And her bespangled robe doth waveAnd in the Summer Garden rove.And led me off to church with song.And comfort of each country dame,And soon Onguines door besideAnd an old gent the poet markingAnd devastate the woods around.And leave a marsh the fertile groundAnd bitter tears of fright I shed.And disappear in space; then sheAnd terrify a swarm of ducks,And leaning gainst the portal closedAnd ease and fashionable waste,And thus in season the rich fieldAnd all the three to breakfast went;And the sagacious Triquet backAnd views amongst themselves advanceAnd to the field of honour led;And traces with a slender fingerAnd blush to own himself reflect.And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:And breathe a drama in his ear.And breathes upon the chilly glass,And long internal agitationAnd a boy handed round the cream.And sometimes into snares as wellAnd he had made her heart beat quick!And a guitar produced we see,And now she skips and now she springsAnd gallicisms I love as wellAnd what she from the cards inferred.And where at last his bones reposeAnd enmity and hope and loveAnd Flinoff, pensioned councillor,And Eugene soon discovered thereAnd truffles, dear to youthful eyes,And visit many a foreign clime,And the lone secret of her heart,And every year distributedAnd the young ladies fortunes told,And the Skatnines, aged pair,And leads a solitary life?And when for Olga nurse arrayedAnd true, his pistols faultless aimAnd every morning I awakeAnd a new diadem supplied.And dark and drear the evenings were,And death before the husband wideAnd oft in whispers would impartAnd mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?And when the watery mirror gleamedAnd the cold beauties of the season:And by the fiddles rushing soundAnd thus he never fell amongAnd gossip of the town and fashionAnd more imagination teems.And oft its Dictionary thumb.And all thy precious elegies,And a grand festival proceeds.And cannot anything conceal,And to Onegin far awayAnd Lenski, closing his left eye,And lo! five paces more they pass,And honestly tis my beliefAnd with gray hair ambrosialAnd secretly their views expound.And many a day thereafter laidAnd all the joys which Winter knows.And in addition youth is flameAnd thus unto her nurse did say:And his strange conduct at the danceAnd necessary fools allowed.And gloomy epigrams malicious.And be as happyas I might.And yet the citys flower was there,And following them ye might espyAnd never was the ear affrightAnd platitudes and pedantry,And long her eyes as through a hazeAnd I to give thee cakes was wont?And since I pulled thee by the earAnd alphabetically triesAnd from the misty woodland nighAnd to the Bourse the cabman plies;And exclamations and good cheer.And jests doth recapitulate.And now tis night, the guardian moonAnd madrigals I'm asked to write!And like his shadow dogged his life,And a malicious epigramAnd then monsieur supplied her place;And isolated from all men,And Flinoff, somewhat indisposed,And Comet champagne foaming flows.And cares not farther to proceed;And soon the friendly troop hath fled.And a half rubles down gave she;And irrigate them with champagne;And all with one accord agreed,And gallops to her house away.And when her violence reviewedAnd never hath our language proudAnd wheresoeer thy footsteps err,And many another slily sneered;And kindness Tania was impressed,And endless the cotillon seemedAnd fits of coughing racked her chest.And the far mountains daintilyAnd the conviction soon arose,And satisfied with vengeance taen.And beckon to the passing sails.And silent as the maid SvetlanaAnd roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;And in her native language sheAnd meditative homeward goes,And read our newspapers scarce ever,And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.And wholly occupied his dayAnd hebut of him presentlyAnd galloped home.

All combineAre admirable, my dear friend,Are oft deceptivelike their feet.Are all your relatives quite well?Are ye replaced by other maidsArising with the mornings light,Around the garden homeward hies.Around her neck, now violentlyAround my stanzas incompleteAround the carriage of the pairAround the meadow and the grove.Arouse yourselves, fair ones.Aroused Tattiana from her bed.Aroused in him sweet reverie.Aroused in him some tenderness.Arouses rustics from their sleep.Arrange without the least delayAs many dinners I rehearse,As once, to fill the rapid pageAs many entertainments be!As with innumerable fires.As a poetic life serene,As partner of my mournful days,As rosy lips without a smile,As in her heart the thought sank home,As if against obstruction soreAs Saadi anciently averredAs in a garden when I grew,As when the tempests veil is drawnAs butterflies to blossoms cling.As storms which in chill autumn rageAs it were, tore himself away.As men who much had done that day.As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,As lordly mansions ought to be,As if it were some funeral feast.As giddy youths hilarityAs vernal storms the fields athwart.As one who bivouacs afield,As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,As the sins of my youthful daysAs if impossible it wereAs in some frenzied dream of fearAs formerly much agitation.As bees who leave their dainty storeAs a babes slumber, or the lightAs Winter in their purity,As in their turn the seasons roll.As formerly the shepherd sitsAs hope uncertain and as sweet,As for her spouse he loved her dearly,As yet none had discovered aught;As we lure the young gallant,As in a thickets humble shade,As if with eider-down is filled.As to a worthy man and good!As cyphers others to appraise,As thoughts which gentle maidens have,As in the timid forest deer,As if he cruelly had joked!As every journal now entreats,As deaf and silly doth remain,As your light footprints on the green.As the reflection of his age,As on the rapid wings of thoughtAs if some troubled dream she dreamed.As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,As oft to meat and drink advert,Aside she casts her veil of gauzeAside the foes their mantles threw,Assemble from the neighbourhood:Assemblies oligarchicalAssigned a lodging, from the hallAssistance ever will extend,Assuredly should not have beenAsunder was and hate prepared?At home arriving he addressedAt early morn returns the maidAt the front gates, but in brief spaceAt prisoners base she never played.At neighbouring hospitalities.At last became a ruined man.At morn, hand clasped in hand, they roveAt times, if only once a week,At first such contradictions wroughtAt times three words to him addressedAt a great feast against desire,At each extreme one takes his stand,At fifty who relief obtainedAt thirty who was married well,At twenty who was prig or swell,At forty suffered from the gout,At last the author! cries Mamma.At the same hour she oped her eyesAt morn an icy bath withinAt last my father gave his blessing,At eventide would hither come,At last is shrunk and withered quite?At table she was sitting byAt his pale brow a shot to have,At first, I clung to secrecy:At Lrinas.Hem, that is queer!At an old aunts they had arrivedAt first, but soon became inuredAt Lrinas abode producedAt times talk nonsense with design;At times to silence would resort,At morn I must assuredlyAt Russ she was by no means cleverAt eighteen not to play the fool!At first for books was disinclined,At seven in summer rose from bed,At least their accents and their wordsAt this time almost understood.At times my reason almost bends,At womankind he growled a curse,At least by show of sympathy;Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,Athwart the snow four paces cameAttend in male attire arrayed.Attentive listened to the lad.Attentive to the echoing sound,Attentive listened to his speech,Attentive to the hearts first beating,Attentive be unto my rhymesAttractive in its banefulness?Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,Auroras ruddy rays of lightAuthors replete with sacred fireAutocrat of the drawing-room seek?Avenge himself in proper style.Avowal then twas time to pray,Await the long-delayed caress.Awaiting on the shore I roamAwakens secret merrimentAway her golden earrings tore;Away! and cease to ring their praiseAway, Tattiana, hath been taen.Awhile this beauty captivated,Awhile sound conversation seemsAye bids ye in some way or otherBack to his regiment must roam.Baggage is heaped up in a mound,Balconies, lions heads on doors,Baptized Prascovia Pauline,Baratynski (_Feasts_)Bard of the Feasts, and mournful breast,Bard of the Finnish maiden young.Barely to draw her breath she seems,Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,Barking, young ladies osculations,Basins and jugswell! everythingBear goneshe at the threshold placed;Beats that of friends and relatives:Because a member I became.Because in singleness of thoughtBecause she was so innocent,Because he could not gourmandiseBecause her passion wanted art,Because my lord, in battles maimed,Because I should be sure, meanwhile,Because he yawned at the bare viewBecome a faithful wife and eenBecome alarmed. So never mind!Bedding is laid out and to allBefore a cold indifferent crowd,Before such fond simplicityBefore whom once in solitude,Before him red roast beef is seenBefore the dregs they shall divineBefore the altar, lo! the pair,Before a fire which feebly glowsBefore you agonized to dieBefore her straight with roguish eyes.Before whose inexperienced sightBefore it ran a stream. Behold!Before he eighteen years attained.Before him her wild game of chance.Begins to talk of this and that,Behind her a grave general.Behind the mill.

Ah! good news to-day!He was no more! The youthful bardHe kindled his poetic flame.He who economy abhorred,He fixedly upon her staresHe thought so, and existence charmed.He was beloved: or say at least,He cared no longer there to stay,He seemed for matrimony born.He who life's frosts which early wrungHe found them in an almanac,He on his bosom gently placedHe drops his pistol silently.He now a full possession takes,He took the room wherein the oldHe called to mind Tattianas grace,He is a charming youth and wise.He a polite reply doth scrawl.He called upon me Christmas EveHe offers her his murderous paw;He roars, and Ah! Tattiana cries.He wakesthey with a letter comeHe enters. High the cork aroseHe quits the fashionable throngHe bending whispered in her earHe reads at random, reads in vain.He bowed to her nor silence broke,He round the billiard-table stalked,He usually was glad to seeHe sat, and then the livelong day,He salutary rules poured forth?He knows Kaverine will repair.He was no fool, and Eugene mine,He was most gay. The happy dateHe has returned, say in what guise?He takes his seat, concludes his game,He deemed his friends but longed to makeHe conversation would have ledHe was a dangerous fool indeed.He with his little maiden played,He felt the laudable desireHe witnessed tenderly and movedHe is not there: I am not known:He promised here this day to ride,He used to hateand was no foolHe could in disputation shineHe found him on the table laid,He back as from a sudden blow?He enters the saloon.

She found a secret joyWherein I buried left my heart.Wherein love innocently pines.Wherein the miserable wifeWherein I felt loves fatal dart,Wherein my poor old nurse doth lieWherein a space Onegin spent.Wherein the child of fashion strictWherein I castigation get;Wherein we lately left the twain.Wherein the heart its vows expressed,Whereto in language courteousWhich is he? or an imitation,Which crushing dignity must brook!Which rushed in eager dense arrayWhich Autumn late to earth consigned,Which your true friend with a sweet smileWhich all her darling friends have scrawledWhich might for many ages last.Which of approaching labour tellsWhich neath her pillow lay till morn.Which shines with iridescent hues.Which in the elevated sphereWhich falls in starry flakes below.Which afterwards the muse revived.Which never have existed, eenWhich to the neighbouring alley leads,Which lessons unto us repeat,Which o'er the waters boldly leap,Which glowed with virginal desire.Which we experienced long ago.Which from the devils bookcase start,Which in your spirit dominates,Which in a hilly neighbourhoodWhich in the winter were a joy:Which rankled in Tattianas breast,Which Ovid once immortalized,Whilst Petersburg from slumber deepWhilst the fond parents, friends thro life,Whilst the tired serving-men withoutWhilst homeward by the nearest routeWhilst on the floor Monsieur TriquetWhilst he belle Nina had the faceWhilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirredWhilst all creation seemed to dreamWhilst Eugene condescending quite,Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,Whilst struggling for the heritage.Whilst cheerily the embers shone,Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,White Moscow raises her old spires,Whither along them doth he pelt?Whither away? Deuce take the bard!Whither that evening he will go.Whither shall my rapscallion flit?Whither two neighbouring dames have walkedWhither at headlong speed doth goWhither shall he go first? Hell see,Whither and wherefore do I speedWhither departed is the host?Who the romance do not complete,Who dressing-gown and slippers givesWho words and actions will adjustWho early died a gallant death_,Who selfishly unmoved remainWho secretly denounced the gift,Who cannot conjure former joys?Who arrived lately from Tamboff,Who now could fail to recognizeWho can help loving mother Moscow?Who from two years to thirty tell;Who reads his visionary themeWho would have thought it? As of yore!Who had for four long years survivedWho following Petrarch move alongWho for the greenwood quits his tower,Who dreams expound and prophecies.Who this soft nonsense could impart,Who every gesture, every phraseWho in the orchards gathered fruit,Who to surrender did not blenchWho would the maiden innocentWho floats contentedly through life,Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,Who thrives this moment as I write,Who by a haughty word or glanceWho will be there?The family.Who knows? with loves consuming flameWho with the Spanish envoy speaks?Who in the agony of griefWho without more prevaricationWho with a scuffle and a shoutWho glory, wealth and dignitiesWho tyrannizes us with ease,Who may he be? Is it Eugene?Who art thou? Guardian angel sentWho to the youthful hostess bowed,Who labours hard to humour us?Who, heard the music of my lay,Who? Is it that stout general, pray?Wholly beside herself with fear,Whom thirty centuries adore.Whom hath thy strain immortalized?Whom vice, if named, doth agitateWhom jealous transport cannot move,Whom autocratic fates decreesWhom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?Whom pale Dianas ray illumesWhom you in slumber may have seen.Whom latterly one often meetsWhom, as the custom is of men,Whose author nature understoodWhose hearts responsive have remainedWhose tones Apollos sons inspire,Whose hands indulgently caressWhose memory doth not refuseWhose qualities appeared to affordWhose heart experience icy madeWhose countless golden crosses glowWhose brain no fond illusions daze,Whose memories make the heart beat quickWhose glance reflecting inspirationWhy did you visit our poor place?Why did you leave last night so soon?Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?Why, as God ordered! My IvanWill be absorbed by Lethes stream;Will he pursue?But no one came.Will not five centuries exceedWill not, preserved by kindly Fate,Will happiness replace. My God!Will sound an insult in your ear.Will pass; the same to-morrow tryWill be ascribed by treacherous FameWill to the old times faithful be.Will you?Agreed.I thank you, friend,Will teach grammatical conceits,Winter resigned her empire white,Winter! The peasant blithely goesWinters approach she doth not hailWith smiling face he Lenski hears;With our Onegin doth aspireWith bitter tears my mother prayed,With fir-trees standing motionlessWith footsteps tremulous with aweWith boiling torrent dark and gray;With sad refrain misfortune near.With intellect and strong volitionWith childlike lisp will lie to please.With an imagination wild,With one paw strokes her face and purrs,With words of foreign originWith sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,With rapturous longing he awaits,With humble prose I'll fill my pageWith its exhilarating flow,With intellect, a taste refined,With blunted pencil-point adorns.With roses, caps and looks malign;With Eugene pranks of former yearsWith this unpleasant _tte--tte_,With us is easily attained.With us tis quite a noveltyWith his ferocious mate appears.With what avidity and zestWith satisfaction marvellous,With clouded brow stands silently?With jealous fear, anxiety.With me Caucasian rocks beside!With vale finish off a note;With tenderness hath recognizedWith serious air then went awayWith lengthened howl and accent loud,With his own pawn alas! his rook!With mute appeal to ask they seemWith scandals trivial ornament.With her they did associate,With all dissatisfaction shows.With blessings on the ditches andWith love which happiness extends;With hopeless passion: from her bedWith spiritual tenderness;With many a vacancy, tis said.With eye precise and without fail.With his exasperated sense,With it may be a couple more;With one foot resting on its tipWith folded arms and eyes bent low,With late repentance gnaws and stings.With bated breath, around she bendsWith flame more ardent passion burns,With which blind Fortune oft betraysWith so much warmth and intellect?With taffety instead of crape.With Ozeroff was wont to shareWith thoughts of a far distant land,With tumult or contentment stillWith deeper woe than others grief.With hisses Cleopatra scares,With blood instead of ink she scrawled,With laughter smothered weariness:With gay design and silken stitch.With worldly honours, it may be,With iridescent wing doth flapWith raspberries, cherries.With cherries, red currants,With dance and with song.With him were friends eternally:With epigrams impertinent,With measured step and even gaitWith many a snare their pathway line!With affectation,nothing more.With shame I shudder and with dreadWith thee I conversed when I boreWith such a perversity proclaim.With pallid light, but Eugene layWith hurried hand smooths down his hair.With lovers rubbish filled, was neatWith ardent sighs and flatteryWith tears which secret sufferers loveWith this immoderate requestWith the epistle of my fair;With inexact pronunciationWith jest and gossip gaily blent.With pungent or obtuse retort,With quite a lachrymose expressionWith little knowledge and that wrongWith the Well-Wisher in her hand!With Olga; nor of this appearedWith better half as cumbersome;With great delight.O God on high!With loud explosion, the bright wineWith jealous fire resuscitate,With effort she restrains. Well nighWith hope and then perplexity,With unanimity complete,With all their progeny were there,With purple hand Aurora leads,With Martin Zadeka. In woeWith tears, confused emotions, bliss,With book in hand reclined in bed,With tranquil air Onegin leadsWithin her; she is sick at heart;Within its wave the sounding pail,Within that secret court discussed,Within resounded shriek and shout:Within his sledge the stiffened corse,Within his memory there lay,Within my memory I boreWithin his mind Tattiana bore,Without them Eugene is complete;Without grammatical mistakes.Without the least constraint he bowed.Without the ken of parents both,Without disguise ourselves explain.Without amaze or wrath displayed:Without a chance to slip away.Without profession, business, wife,Without disgust we look upon?Without constraint in conversationWithout enthusiasm he metWithout the faintest trace to leaveWithout participation hears,Would you to me this Phyllis show,Would she the canvas tight enrichWould agitate a mystic wreathWould lose his slippers or gazette.Would she in silence long remain.Would haste in agitation direWould at the proper time appear.Would whisper: shall I so long live?Would once in powdered wig appear;Would loiter by the looking-glass,Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.Wrapt in oblivion complete,Writ in my honour now and thenYawning betook him to a pen.Ye feel but little interest,Ye billows of blue Hadrias sea,Ye need dissimulation baseYe dreams of heavenly poesy?Ye groves whose depths I know so well,Ye well-known mountain summits high,Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!Ye shadows of a life more high,Ye miracles of courtly grace,Ye golden days of my young spring?Ye men of fashion cynical,Ye mothers also, caution use,Yea! although rendered beauteousYea! and a man of honour, lo!Years have inclined me to stern prose,Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,Yes! every one must have his foes,Yes! for our unpretending home,Yes, happythough she at his sideYet neither Virgil nor RacineYet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,Yet still her heart, which torments tear,Yet with a feigned frigidityYet was her inmost soul oerjoyedYet I in idleness expendYet as a rule their talk I callYet suffering emotionalYet curses on his fate bestowing,Yet still of anecdotes a treasureYet viewing her from head to foot,Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,Yet clearer shines than every lightYet still apparently aspireYet on a frosty winter dayYet sometimes this or that deceitYet satiated with success,Yet let us part in friendship, OYet still remains the old despair.Yet sometimes banished hopes will riseYet sometimes pages two or threeYon silly moon upon the brinkYonder the household lad doth run,You fall in love again. But stillYou o'er your wine insulted hathYou never would have heard the name,You with stern countenance declareYou will not all abandon me.You have a letter to me sent.You choose.But who is she?My wife.You in the least commiserateYou know that I am now a foolYou never since your nose have shown.You, he a noble mind disclosed,Youll find her portrait there, I vouch;Youll spend your winter famously!Young ladies faces and their feet.Young ladies in a vasty curve,Young maidens, fair maidens,Young ladies, if ye ever stroveYour heart possesses, I know well,Your conversation cold and hard,Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keepYour smiling lips, your beaming eyes,Your frankness I shall compensateYour second you have left behind!Your fashionable world I hate,Your magic voices I shall greet,Your innocent and charming noteYouth freshens beneath Passions showers,Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,Zaretski with a knowing grin,Zaretski rose, nor would explain,Zaretski shouted: Why, hes killed!Zaretski paces thirty-twoZaretski and Monsieur GuillotZaretski, once a bully bold,Zaretski, village mechanician,Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,_Come to my golden palace, dear_!_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,_Quecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?__Who in thy love finds more delight_Affectionately yours till death_._The peasants there are rich as kings,_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_._Sed alia tempora_.
