In the country weAnd satisfied with vengeance taen.And the far mountains daintilyAnd the cold beauties of the season:And the young ladies fortunes told,And the young girl appeared beforeAnd the Skatnines, aged pair,And the sagacious Triquet backAnd that a bottle sealed with tarAnd to revive Tattiana seemed.And testy gamesters do engageAnd this fifth canto ought to beAnd viewed the door with cunning eye.And what she from the cards inferred.And what from its recess appears?And wildly waves its arms and storms;And well-instructed to betray!And yet oblivion forbade.Anew the flames of passion startAn explanation: she was scared,Another bard with art divineAnother with cocks head appeared,Anticipating woe she pined,A new acquaintance we must scan.An ace at fifteen paces bored.And all the three to breakfast went;And about dawn upon his breastAnd ancient usages observedAnd all that from thy hand proceedsAnd abject slaves who kiss the rod;And blest the shadows of the night.And blush to own himself reflect.And by that shady rivuletAnd, by the light the moonbeams gave,And contemplative dreaminess;And dames of fine organisations,And enmity and hope and loveAnd flowed harmoniously. He tookAnd finally, upon his bedAnd flooded all the level ground.And grasps a pen: his verse, albeitAnd glittering simpletons beside;And grant his weary bones their restAnd hurried home his awful freight.And homeward like an arrow tore.And his poor basten sandal knits.And if Tattiana mine had foundAnd is it true her garland brightAnd is it true and not a jest,And is all light within destroyed?And in her languid bosom raiseAnd lessons to his children read.And lo! he is already there!And linen on him doth bestow.And lo! five paces more they pass,And Lenski, closing his left eye,And lo! where lies a marble tombAnd long her eyes as through a hazeAnd mental elasticity.And meditative from the spotAnd make a dark existence shineAnd mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?And now, I mournfully confess,And ought he not to disregardAnd past the threshold of decay,And reads with rapid eager eyeAnd rest from bygone days of strife.And sometimes into snares as wellAnd scanned in silence its content.And so departed. But Eugene,And Schiller read by candlelight.And spouted it with lyric fireAnd slowly life coagulatesAnd so my noon hath come!

Where his troubled dreams,He quits the fashionable throngHer cheek of rosy lovelinessHer foot was in my other hand.He reads at random, reads in vain.Here bottles stand in close array,Herein my portrait should detect,Here I remark all poets areHe racked his brains to find its clueHer all in all did constitute;Her bosom heaves whilst crimson huesHer caps and night-dresses to mend.Her eyes were of cerulean blue,Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.Her girlish gaiety and sport.Her Grandison was in the Guard,Her husband was a bridegroom then,Her head upon her breast declinesHer health, life's sweetness and its bloom,Her in the pitfalls which we place.Her locks were of a golden hue,Her movements, voice and figure slight,Her Moscow cousin, often toldHer passions faithful counterpart,Her sentimental verses all,Her suit before my parents pressing:Her smile and maidenly repose,Her tears and her dishevelled hair;Her weary eyes are filled with tearsHe round the billiard-table stalked,Her figure perfect grows with time!Herself not knowing well the reason,He roars, and Ah!

The happy dateHe was beloved: or say at least,He will delight you, I am sure,He whom we sing to shall be madeHe was no fool, and Eugene mine,He was deceived. Just as beforeHe wrote (tis the romantic style,He was in error; for EugeneHe would not that a man ye slayHe was no more!

His clouded eyeHis inner consciousness laid bare,His immorality of mindHis intellect in close array.His kneeling posture he retainsHis lyre, to silence now consigned,His malady, whose cause I weenHis mother from the door doth scold.His momentary loving glanceHis mournful heart no peace could find,His neighbours lowly tomb and mournedHis name: the tenderness of homeHis own antagonists expert,His pony sniffing the fresh snowsHis ruffian bravery adored,His recent glory he invokes.His relative and friend as well.His son and mortgages his lands.His shop, a night-cap on his head,His spirit sank with strange delight.Hissed forth.

Tis too bad!Some are afar and some are dead.Ah! than a spectre from the deadAbove the ashes of the dead.Wheneer he had an aching head;To seek him out with bended head.Shaking with serious air the head,Now of a family the head,His shop, a night-cap on his head,And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.And gently hovered o'er my head?All silently hung down his head.And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.For patience, reader, I must plead!Or a swift hare from mead to meadBut on the third of grove and meadBut ah! discerns nor wood nor meadTis finished. Horrible to read!Thereon the passing traveller read:The first-fruits of my tale I read,That certain volumes she might read.Some nice instructive novel read,No other book had time to read.I slumber much, a little read,I Apuleius gladly readFor on their brows I trembling readDo not excuse yourself. I readBut word for word his letter read.But presently she tried to read;And lessons to his children read.A little farther please to readAnd pauses oft to serve out bread.With shame I shudder and with dreadUnto a ruthless tyrant dread.And it may be a secret dreadThe pile of books, with carpet spreadNor slander viciously could spreadAnd two old pines their branches spreadFor the impatient chief instead.And cool sagacious mind he had:Although we know that Eugene hadTattiana loved as when a lad,Attentive listened to the lad.Inhabited the country, cladIn dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:But Lenski, I should be so gladHe long should have been on the road.He dragged her by a forest roadGrant that I err not on the road.Could taste the pleasures of the road.Time flies! a genial air abroad,I was incensed and he was sad.In love-lorn meditation sad.His arm he offers. Mute and sadAn idle anchorite and sad,Still certain authors, I may add,(_Mechanically_, let us add),With hopeless passion: from her bedWith book in hand reclined in bed,Undressed herself and went to bedTis time for supper, now for bed,She could not sleep in her new bed.Beneath the window-sill his bed,At seven in summer rose from bed,Aroused Tattiana from her bed.And finally, upon his bedSo she her silken sash unlaced,Upon the tumbled sofa placed,The friends are called and quickly placed.Right opposite Tattiana placed,Most carefully Zaretski placedIn coach or post-cart duly placedHe on his bosom gently placedExcept one by the window placedEugene in hackney carriage placed.Beneath her downy pillow placed,Bear goneshe at the threshold placed;The ancient _barshtchina_ replacedAnd exclamations interlaced.The two old ladies then embracedLay all the girls by sleep embraced,In what he merely acquiesced.To all good neighbours sport conduced.At Lrinas abode producedAll overtures of friendship ended.Most by this circumstance offendedThe workpeople she superintended,The bath on Saturdays attended,Vice had due punishment awarded,Virtue was with a bride rewarded.When to enlarge we shall succeed,Tis done.

Hes killed!_The channel of the river stilledOur tender dreamer had enrolledA gambling troop when he controlled,By Faublas in his youth was schooled,Surely ye all have overhauledWith blood instead of ink she scrawled,Which all her darling friends have scrawledAnd in her conversation drawled.Transparent o'er the Neva beamedThe peace which on his forehead beamed,But kindness from his eye had beamedAnd when the watery mirror gleamedThe purest of the dreams we dreamed,She never of deception dreamedHer the ideal which he dreamed,As if some troubled dream she dreamed.His elegies, which plenteous streamed,The blood gushed from the wound and steamedWhy is Tattiana guiltier deemed?Onegin was so many deemed,But one buffoon unhappy deemedA few of different temper deemed,That our desires which noblest seemed,Both natural and truthful seemed.And to revive Tattiana seemed.And endless the cotillon seemedFeeling in others much esteemed.A notoriety proclaimed,Because my lord, in battles maimed,When hopes delightful flower but bloomedHe thought so, and existence charmed.And he who, jealousy disarmed,How soon to habits she conformedAh! how Tattiana was transformed,To say farewell, and fussed and fumedThe manly toga scarce assumed,Only her countenance assumedTattiana in despair unfeignedWhere many another hand had signedAnd vows will probably be signed:Though, God be praised! he ne'er designedThat, for the century designed,Tall, slender, like thy form designed,Her money counted, and designedCaricatures he now designedMade revelations undesigned,To arid selfishness resigned,Spring cheered him up, and he resignedOr even, silent and resigned,Which Autumn late to earth consigned,When harsh demeanour hath consignedOnce more to idleness consigned,His lyre, to silence now consigned,Have eer a precious tress consigned,What do I ask? What cause assignedA happy destiny ordained:A valuable hostage gained,A modern Regulus unchained,Tattiana o'er the stream complained;Whose hearts responsive have remainedRooted unto the spot remained.Inseparable they remained.O ye whom tender love hath painedAnd saying this Vladimir drainedShe consolation thence obtainedAt fifty who relief obtainedA something somehow have obtained,My sum of happiness contained;He sang of life's fresh colours stainedWith us is easily attained.Hath tranquilly in turn attained,Before he eighteen years attained.The fruits of learning and combinedA tender couplet he combined,And handsome countenance combined,With intellect, a taste refined,His chambers close wherein confinedLove to idealize inclined;I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.At first for books was disinclined,And on the last one, underlined:Anticipating woe she pined,The venerable dame opinedCertain misfortune near opined.Now a long branch itself entwinedConstant affection intertwinedIf the fond hope I could have fannedTattiana (nurse the project planned)There, aping Gulnares bard, he spannedThough Baratynski verses penned,The date was fixed though oft postponed,The maidens weary eye which yearned,A spirit which for sorrow yearned.Tattiana more than ever burnedHis neighbours lowly tomb and mournedTo his Penates now returned,Tattiana thanks to all returned,The voice of jealousy is drowned.He on the conflagration frowned.Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.The matchmaker a fortnight sped,Our heroes at full gallop sped,Into the cups already spedOf lackeys in her pathway grouped,Thy cheek is as a poppy red!Their glory with their heels of redOf his approach; but nothing caredAn explanation: she was scared,A countenance perplexed and scared.Her features no grimaces bleared;With Olga; nor of this appearedTo an assemblyshe appearedThe tea, as I remarked, appeared,In dressing-gown at meals appeared.But this a heinous crime appearedBut in the drawing-room all appearedBut Adam Smith to read appeared,A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.And Tanias husband soon appeared.Another with cocks head appeared,A faithful model she appearedO yes! my hopes soon disappeared.My image hath not disappeared,For evermore had disappeared.Meals, secrets, occupations shared?He went notsooner was preparedAsunder was and hate prepared?I mused: perhaps the matters squaredUpon the Dons broad pastures bredQuarrels among young friends he bredBoth ducks and geese in plenty bredHomer, Theocritus, he jeered,And many another slily sneered;In her affairs ne'er interfered,Seemed in a haze of green embowered.The valleys dried and gaily flowered;His soul by crash of music fired,Extinct the flame which once had fired;By indolence and languor firedTo kiss the feet which I admired!Singing God knows what maid admired,In amorous flights when so inspired,Tis in your power now, if desired,The fated nutriment desired;How like the billow I desiredHis tea with rum no more desired,And both of dull existence tired,I write to you! Is more required?I long by ballets have been bored,An ace at fifteen paces bored.Though beauty he no more adored,Since Fame and Freedom he adored,His ruffian bravery adored,Either she saw not or ignored;Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,Contented and with victuals stored,And harmony was soon restored.Deeming himself a veteran scarredThus widely meditation erred,Tattiana through the forest erred,I long enough deceived have erred.Of the romances she preferred,And what she from the cards inferred.The Medal Otchakoff conferred!Tattiana every day conferredOf Olga he in song averred;As Saadi anciently averredWhilst from her countenance ne'er stirredIn the recesses what hath stirredAnd by a partial temper stirredAnd by a genuine sorrow stirred,Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.Onguines speeches I abhorredHe who economy abhorred,What hath he dreamed?

She refused.And though her soul might be confused,Some Russian authors he perusedNot that she had his works perused,A book at early morn perused.In fact, the subject analysed,Even so! His passions soon abated,They sang, whilst negligently seated,He ought to have conciliatedBy daily life deteriorated,He might his motives have narrated,Her inmost soul had penetrated,Nor long his mind was agitatedAwhile this beauty captivated,Were to analysis subjected.Hath she a fitting phrase selected?And life and fate in turn selectedThey long at home have her expectedTattiana with impatience waitedHis visit she had not awaited,A bastard fame prohibited?Vladimir Lenski visitedHow the young imp on Tania doted!To captivate her how devoted!By Olgas hand distributedAnd every year distributedOf what he thought and what believed,All mothers their sweet girls believedAnd she at last hath us deceived;Lenski as a good match received,In vain was youth by us received,Upon those margins she perceivedRetained the image, though short-lived,The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:At an old aunts they had arrivedA new proprietor arrived,The fatal tubes Lepage contrivedWhich afterwards the muse revived.The conversation was revivedWho had for four long years survivedTurned and replied as it behoved,When but a boy he Olga lovedAnd ditties of the steppe she loved.Perceived that he was still beloved,Onegin, by first impulse moved,He witnessed tenderly and movedAlready by repentance movedAnd as a country damsel roved,Strictly the Carnival observed,For first madame his wants observed,And these the attentive maid observedAnd ancient usages observed(For which our praise he hath deserved).Her bow was easy, unreserved.They in a peaceful life preservedBut proudly in his song preservedBut Eugene was by fate preserved,And numerous pages had preservedA mien unaltered she preserved,The gifted songster never swerved,Journeys and warriors to wed.And when her violence reviewedThe breath of Spring again renewed,Simple and kindly and unwed,Without the least constraint he bowed.Who to the youthful hostess bowed,In company, or simply bowed,Till amid trees a hovel showed,Onegin ne'er as poet showedHe gazed upon the clock which showedEt cetera_; but nothing showedA scant attendance Lenski showedBut from the interview what flowed?The insensate fire of love still glowedPassions wild sway I then allowed,In correspondence been allowed.He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,Enraptured was he if allowedAnd necessary fools allowed.And privileges nice allowed,Having a trusty staff bestowed,Please her by their decorum fixed,Titles and ages intermixed.The deuce with my inside has played.The drama of my youth was played.He with his little maiden played,Eight rubbers were already played,At prisoners base she never played.Without amaze or wrath displayed:Meadows and cornfields are displayed,In Olgas face no life's displayed.With bitter tears my mother prayed,Attend in male attire arrayed.And when for Olga nurse arrayedThat we her constantly betrayedThus carelessly I once portrayedChange of position had essayed,There long time sad at heart he stayed:Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.Yet was her inmost soul oerjoyedUpon a soul inert and cloyed?Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,Of course Tattiana was annoyedAnd is all light within destroyed?What is your name? The boor looked dazed,She on the apparition gazed,Again imagination blazed,And vehemently though amazedAnd Agathon replied, amazed.Whom hath thy strain immortalized?Which Ovid once immortalized,With tenderness hath recognizedFor which the poet agonizedIn much his conduct stigmatized;And long perukes hath vanishd.Tattiana doth accept his aid;Her Martin Zadeka in aid,The powder in the pan is laid,He found him on the table laid,And many a day thereafter laidAnd her upon the threshold laid.Singing inside her hut the maidShould go, the market for a maid,She comprehends. The simple maidRemained with him the youthful maid.Of a young dark-eyed country maid,My pretty self-deceiving maidMine own ideal, the mountain maid,In Olgas album, youthful maid,For shame lift up the modest maid.Beneath her parents eyes the maidAt early morn returns the maidAnd for Tattiana, mournful maid,And, hanging down her head, the maidAnd crossed with trembling hand the maid.A load of care upon the maid.Alone with my Venetian maid,To classicism I've homage paid,Nor frigid adulation paid.A due which must to earth be paid.Fortune the poet had repaid.That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,She, to turn back her eyes afraid,No time to pick it up! afraid,With many a vacancy, tis said.What they in conversation said?Vladimir something curtly saidThough scarcely following what was said,Poor Yorick, mournfully he said,Onegin then approached and said:In whispers low the neighbours said:Gazing into his face, she said:But finally she softly said:And the old nurse a brief prayer saidAdieu she to the matron saidAnd spectacles, his knitting staidSo be it! Just the laws which bidBetter than Chateaubriand didA ball he fell as Tchatzki did.In mist profound all yet is hid.Had rendered him an invalid;Returning, from his ship amidWherefore am I your quarry held?She dreamt she journeyed o'er a fieldAnd thus in season the rich fieldScornfully challenged you afieldAs one who bivouacs afield,What are they? Gladly would I yieldInto thy hands my fate I yield!Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.What can be done? She is no child!And can it be? But late a childAn ardent heart and yet so mild?With an imagination wild,And now a fickle flirt and wild,We never loved in days of old,These evenings as in days of oldTattiana in traditions oldI also wandered there of old,He took the room wherein the oldBut that Princess Pauline of old,An almanac but eight years old.And the suspicious veteran old,And Limburg cheese alive and oldZaretski, once a bully bold,Werther, rebellious martyr bold,The wolf upon the highways boldThe morn arises foggy, cold,He laughs, although it aches from cold,But cannot stand the northern cold.Blank, unapproachable and cold.And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.His mother from the door doth scold.His housekeeper was wont to scold,How empires store of wealth unfold,The medium is required of gold.Is seen next pine-apples of gold.Afar, where clothed in green and goldSome marriageable maids behold,In one he doth accounts behold,Before it ran a stream. Behold!Alas! she is as hard, behold,Her Moscow cousin, often toldHad killed me had the like been told.And the young ladies fortunes told,In dreams and what the moon foretoldThe Great WorldA journey to Moscow! To see the world!Heard he the truth? And thus she couldTo Olga frequently he wouldShe promised Eugene, or she wouldOf friends unceremonious wouldWith blessings on the ditches andThe Nevas Cleopatra, andOf a strange night when the moon andHer tears flow plentifully andExistthat their immortal bandWith the Well-Wisher in her hand!Than health, so with a trembling handSome wretched journal in his hand;No one appeared to lend a hand.Intoned it, manuscript in hand.Her cheek reclines upon her hand.Her foot was in my other hand.Eugene, his pistol yet in handA weary season was at handA loaded pistol in his hand.With thoughts of a far distant land,When, where, and in what desert land,Of Africa, ancestral land,Friends of the sons of every land,The ruts of his own fatherland.Sickness more courage doth commandIn times gone by thy bare commandAnd in the bathroom did commandThe poet, modest though so grand,To dream upon the sunny strandThose feet? Alas! on what far strandTo see you by our fireside stand,November at the gate did stand.Immersed in secret thought I standGazing on Lenskis corse did standAt each extreme one takes his stand,None the conviction could withstandOh! nurse, nurse, you dont understand!Wearied of leisure in the end,My days of life approach their end,Enough to see one winters end;Charms more enduring in the end.And thou, persistent to the end,And had with waddling in the endTo thy decree my will I bend.To Love all ages lowly bend,To cock the pistol; barrel bendA passionate desire to bendThe thunderbolt on you descend!Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!Will you?Agreed.I thank you, friend,On thigh or temple, friend on friend.In duel having killed his friendBut thou, Bordeaux, art like the friendAre admirable, my dear friend,And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,Their natural attractions lendIf not, the money I will lend.An ear to my confession lend;And, sobbing at your feet, to blendHer caps and night-dresses to mend.His gusts should fertilize, amend,And they the waters recommend.Yet I in idleness expendAll to the doctors Eugene send,Into the starry night extend.Farther Tattianas walks extendAssistance ever will extend,Quick to the country let us wendBut finally in wedlock bind.Where thine equal shall we find?Upon the opening page ye find:The young proprietor we find;Scarcely in Russia can ye findInfallibly you there will findHis mournful heart no peace could find,Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,But what astonished do I findBut trembles, words he cannot find,Your second you have left behind!The wood she entersbear behind,Of dreary Russia left behind,Perchance to benefit mankind,Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!That I to you reveal my mind?So uncongenial to my mind,Onguines pencillings. His mindOne image occupied his mind,Of all the guests within his mind.It gradually possessed his mind;His immorality of mindHad perished a creative mind,From mere vacuity of mindDelighted, almost sane in mind.But soon their choice seemed to her mindBut one thought only filled his mind,Become alarmed. So never mind!A pair; though desolate my mind,And the recesses of my mindA fiery and eccentric mind,A duellist of classic mind,Of which the rustling woods remind?Brought by a pedlar vagabondOf whirligigs were very fond,Until her heart less high should boundTwice in the year to fast were bound,These to the coach of state are bound,The lancer, to his calling bound,That mind which yearns for space is bound?She wore her corset tightly bound,Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.By barren snow heaped up and bound,What jokes and guesses now abound,However cherries might abound,Funeral amateurs abound!And stoves of various shapes abound.A stream, by winters ice unbound,(This by command; for it was found,Lo! in my garden was she foundExamined, mended, newly foundAnd if Tattiana mine had foundA beau is for Tattiana found!This monument of thought profoundFrom hence engrossed in thought profoundBaggage is heaped up in a mound,Endless conjectures all propoundAnd secretly their views expound.Recovering, Tania gazes round;Of horn in circle call them round.But, when Onguines turn came round,The snows from off the hills aroundThe German baker looks aroundSelfish nonentities around?Imperial portraits hang aroundBut suddenly all changed around!A tangled wilderness around.And devastate the woods around.And from the country all aroundAnd leave a marsh the fertile groundAnd flooded all the level ground.Amid the snowdrifts which surroundWere stripped with melancholy sound,The Russian N with nasal soundNor at the hour of noon with soundMorning awakes with joyous sound;Attentive to the echoing sound,And by the fiddles rushing soundSoon Olgas accents shrill resoundInside clink glasses, cries resoundCongratulations, toasts resound,If he had only known the woundWill happiness replace. My God!Amid coquettes who pray to GodSeven days and nights the travellers plod.Debate commanded ample foodThe fruits of science, evil, good,Such is the country custom good;As to a worthy man and good!Which in a hilly neighbourhoodHandsome and rich, the neighbourhoodAssemble from the neighbourhood:And spur my spirits torpid mood!Absorbed in melancholy moodBut such is not for me. I broodTattiana as enchanted stood;Sees where a noble mansion stood,Onegin meditative stood,Guillot behind a pollard stood;Whose author nature understoodLessons to give he understood!At this time almost understood.The river through the linden wood.Dark was the valley and the woodA village and beneath, a wood,How I have erred and felt the rod!And abject slaves who kiss the rod;Whither away? Deuce take the bard!Triquet arose, and for the bardHe was no more! The youthful bardA worshipper of Kant, a bard,Here an old witch with hirsute beard,When in the grand saloon was heardWhat never was remarked or heardTattiana would have gladly heardIn loves campaigns Onegin heardHer utterances ever heard,But ye to whom, when friendship heard,And hark! the clank of spurs is heardAnd ought he not to disregardYour conversation cold and hard,The poets madness? for tis hardI wont detain you; but tis hardA noted fop who gambled hard.A young and handsome galliard.What doth she see? Around the boardThe company deep silence guard.Her Grandison was in the Guard,He hies unto the Boulevard,She enters a deserted yardBeneath her lay a strange courtyard,Believed, the peoples wisdom weird,Marmontel also, tome the third;Epistle second, note the third,Whose qualities appeared to affordShe deemed its outline might afford.To dominate her worthy lord,Sighs on another than her lordLo! my Onegin rural lord!Together they returned, nor wordReform me both in deed and word,Onegin wasted; on my word,Each gust of temper, silly word,Command him not to say a wordSeems so unnatural and absurd:Of late I have been quite absurd,With lengthened howl and accent loud,No more the music thunders loud,Of my light paramour was proud.Even as Moscow, city proud.And never hath our language proudPursuits I followed of the crowd,Or recognized not in the crowd.Or he dispersed the motley crowdHe enters: in the hall a crowd,Before a cold indifferent crowd,And I, amid the friendly crowd,Amazed at the confusing crowd,The mystic monogram, O.

the friends to chat commence.And aimless journeys did commenceOh! what had been his eminence!Habit would bring indifference.I yield with a low reverence;To friendship making no pretence,I cannot tell on what pretenceHis energy and impotence.But this adventures consequenceI, after so much eloquence,Not to behave as he did onceOr a good fellow for the nonce,Our idol, Honours motive force,And the newcomers welcome bade.And yet oblivion forbade.Lo!

On every sideIf thou wert sitting by my side,Found them in darkness side by side,But grown familiar side by sideAnd hastened to his uncles side,Mute glances interchanged asideIn consultation stand asideBut now all doubt was set aside,With me Caucasian rocks beside!A pair of bulletsnought besideAnd glittering simpletons beside;And soon Onguines door besideAte Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,Always together, eventideMeet punishment for him provide.Onegin oped the cupboards wide.Beneath her roaring opened wide:And the saloon threw open wide;And death before the husband wideNoblesse and models of the mode,Of a most mournful episode,To foreign lands he would allude,And unto whom we all alludeDeep in the distant province rude,Upon my visions such intrude.Secure in rural quietudeBeneath the flag of Quietude,Where long time he in solitudeThen, thenwell, in some solitudeSince Eugene in that solitudeIn worldly din or solitudeFly frequent to my solitude,Daily of love in solitude.Before whom once in solitude,My soul is filled with gratitude!Measured with great exactitude.Displayed a noble rectitudeMy scholar without aptitudeTo part in amity with thee!Then, I say truly, none but theeHath fate apportioned unto theeFrom henceforth I confide to thee!Tis hopeless!

Come! pretensions mineWell known unto Onegin mine.Please follow this way, lady mine,No other than Onegin mine.In your young days and also mine),In one great shout: shes mine! shes mine!He was no fool, and Eugene mine,Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;But, as I said, Zaretski mineBouynoff, wrathful cousin mine,A new Kaverine Eugene mine,Of my impassioned heroine.Never upon my heroineDreaming herself the heroineA tombstone, Aphrodites shrine,The choicest flowers of French cuisine,Is it for long?Ma chre cousine!Long tortured by his lay divine,Lest the world or her lord divineBefore the dregs they shall divineAnother bard with art divineI love them, O my dear Elvine,With loud explosion, the bright wineOf the cup brimming o'er with wineGive me just half a glass of wineAbout the crop of hay, the wine,Our dear old aunt, Princess Helne,But that the eyes of every oneTo pass the night at home hath gone.The sum of my existence goneCan she have been a moment goneAll to the grand saloon are goneWhilst cheerily the embers shone,The ball in all its splendour shone.That hero, though his merit shone,Frosty the night; the heavens shone;The rivers bank. Tattiana loneOn the steppes of Moldavia lone,Forgotten in the village lone,When, sitting by his fire aloneWaiting his cominghis alone!Upon her brow sits wrath aloneUndoubtedly, disdain aloneTwas these he read and these aloneTranquil repose. Eugene aloneTo sigh and meditate alone:That mediocrity aloneNurse, leave me. I would be alone.Moina recalls for this aloneMaid whom my heart desires alone,In horror for itself alone,Having for moneys sake aloneGood-night. Behold! she is alone!Dies suddenly: of heirs aloneCertainly not Eugene aloneCan hearty welcome give alone.And in the frosty night aloneWhere, where, the trace of tears? None, none!Though around honoured Priams throneThus haughty, careless in her tone?That like a friendly voice its toneThat all may hear his voices tone.Mine! cried Eugene with savage tone.She murmurs in an undertoneSaid something in an undertoneNo answer all that day was borne.Lo! on the sleeping river borne,The nightingale trills forth her tune;A constant harping on one tune,Of fashionable dames the foe,With Martin Zadeka. In woeThe aged woman in her woe:Or quietly partake our woe.Dreaming perchance in weal or woeEen hopeless egoisms dark shape.Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!With taffety instead of crape.His book-shelf instantly doth drapeCould in romantic mantle drapeTo whisper comfort, love and hope?Tis dreadfulye agree, I hopeHad bid her sigh for without hopeIn country solitude you mope,Tis said you are a misanthrope,For a fictitious misanthrope,A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!O Men, how very like ye areI ask, all ye who poets are,Here I remark all poets areThrough aspens, limes and birches bare,His inner consciousness laid bare,Was he in health and void of care?Tattianas beauty, pale with care,I am acquainted with fresh care,Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!Albums magnificent which scareTo cope with Ay no more I dare,Though I confess I hardly dareThe vile seducer shall not dareLenski at intervals would dare,Or vainly mid luxurious fareWith Ozeroff was wont to shareYou with stern countenance declareNone could her beautiful declare,I cannot help it I declare,Doth his brow wretchedness declareAnd impiously should declare,The riot of the world and glareThe crash of music, candles glareAnd the more surely we ensnareWhat pleasures Hymen would prepareBreakfast the busy cooks prepare,But, O ye tomes without compare,Moscows young Graces at her stare,Tattianas love was quite sincere,Now I am fit for nothing here.(I speak not of our poems here),Hes here! Eugene is here!Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.Abandon hope for ever here!Which in the elevated sphereThe moon in the blue atmosphere.With all their progeny were there,The young Simeonova too thereThe left? Why, what on earth is there?Tattiana gently led them there.Or suffering pride? Why is he there?It may be ye were born, or thereI promised!Did I so?Well, there!And yet the citys flower was there,And lo! he is already there!And Eugene soon discovered thereAlone the princess sitteth there,Was born beside the Neva, whereHe bends his course to Talons, whereFaces which we meet everywhereJust as he entered. How severe!I yield the fruit of work severe.And be not in advance severe.Still sovereigns of his spirit were,If the choice in my power were,As if impossible it wereAnd dark and drear the evenings were,Our misanthrope was full of ire,Would haste in agitation direOlga with trepidation dire.Oblivion of life's tempest dire,The proud ones are not worth the fireTheir privileged allurements fireStood as if struck by lightning fire.Or bosom full of languid fire,Nor sparkled with poetic fire,For our Automedons are fireAuthors replete with sacred fireAnd spouted it with lyric fireYet still apparently aspireWith our Onegin doth aspireFoeman or friend, I do aspireWhose tones Apollos sons inspire,Nor wit, nor did the same inspireLike D when dinner doth inspire.He deemed his coming would inspireAnd that no longer could inspire.Which glowed with virginal desire.To mutter her concealed desireThis world. I do not praise desire,So ardently did I desireSlowly exhausted by desire,Raged round him and of balked desire!He felt the laudable desireBut Lenski, having no desireAt a great feast against desire,All that a poet could desire,All that perfection could desire;A hidden train of wild desire.Adieu! whateer thou didst desireHis constant soul could ever tire,And our swift troikas never tire;The wit of others to acquire.With thee I conversed when I boreWithin his mind Tattiana bore,Within my memory I boreOpened with care, and entering boreNow buffoon, glutton, and a bore.And brooding o'er the ills he bore,Tattiana, Russian to the core,Or, as it were, the Freischutz scoreWhom thirty centuries adore.Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?The Russian winter did adoreThoult suffer, dearest, but before,My spirit with such pangs before.He was deceived. Just as beforeHe read as vainly as before,And the young girl appeared beforeThey stir the heart as heretofore.To help her to the other shoreTis time to quit this weary shoreThe captives of the Salguirs shore.Or by the oceans rocky shore.Of the imperial Nevas shore.How oft to the Crimean shoreAnd thy protection I implore.With it may be a couple more;With affectation,nothing more.Society renounced once more.Where Nereids murmur evermore,As if against obstruction soreAway her golden earrings tore;And homeward like an arrow tore.A gust of passion never toreEndowing us from out her storeAs bees who leave their dainty storeNow the sweet little shoes she wore,Bouynoff too, my cousin, woreWho would have thought it? As of yore!Rogue and extortioner of yore,But which, my dear?In days of yoreAs thou, great Homer, didst of yore,A fragile bridge and insecure,Hath gradually learnt to endure;For who imposture can endure,But competition I abjureBut deeming all this nonsense pure,Sit down. How funny, to be sure!He will delight you, I am sure,For longfor ever. To be sureThen my companions young with pleasureIn history he took no pleasure,Found out the secret how at pleasureYet still of anecdotes a treasureIn the unfettered hours of leisureAnd then she soon twixt work and leisureThat my dishonour would ensureSerious endeavours to assureHappy who timely grew mature,For ever with thy tattling lyre,And after Albions proud lyreYe need dissimulation baseFelled a calumniator base!That a friends arm in every caseFor my wild garden and bookcase,Who tyrannizes us with ease,Though he surveyed her at his ease,Glides with a more luxurious ease;But Tanias heart is not at ease,Still the loud stamping doth not cease,With childlike lisp will lie to please.The journey in a sledge doth please,Possession hath no power to please,Napoleon tarried till it pleaseCan I inspect the mansion, please?O epic Muse, my powers increaseTo cool the cutlets seething grease,Of modern Russians the disease.If seriously he hath disease;A very troublesome disease,The curs away to kennel chase,Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.In motley and amusing chase.Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.Who every gesture, every phraseTo russify the foreign phraseNot even a poetic phrase,Moscow! How much is in the phraseI say without poetic phrase,Handbook of fashionable phraseAddress to you one single phraseIt matters not. Hope een to theseFrom careless stanzas such as these,Eugene would speak regarding these.She would pronounce _ la Franaise_;The curtain now they slowly raise.She mourned and to the moon would raiseOf passion they so often raise.How sweet a dream your memories raise!And where the billows hoarsely raiseAnd in her languid bosom raiseTo God eternal hymns of praise.Away! and cease to ring their praiseAs cyphers others to appraise,Because he could not gourmandiseThey growl a bitthey scandaliseTired by the balls incessant noise,Engrave the ice with strident noise.Crushing and a confusing noise;But at her shriek ran forth with noiseCould in a humble sphere despise,Yet sometimes banished hopes will riseWhen Eugene like a ghost did riseThe shopman and the pedlar riseThe crowd doth head and shoulders riseOft upon friendly lips doth rise:Late in the afternoon to rise,In column blue the smoke doth rise;A blood-bespattered shade would rise,Where melancholy rocks ariseThus thou, Yazykoff, dost ariseThose hellish phantoms. Peals ariseOf the night sentinels ariseMiraculously fair arise,And would by candlelight arise.The Lrinas were since sunriseHe has returned, say in what guise?Olga the tea must superviseThe chief of the Chaldean wise,Manforty years long in this wiseIs he the same or grown more wise?He is a charming youth and wise.But now a question in this wiseOlga began to long likewiseWith his exasperated sense,Reduced with effort unto sense,Pervaded with much common sense.May be the empire of the sense,He well-nigh lost the use of sense,And I admired their common senseWe hear with interest intenseThough now my love might be intense,Inspired but weariness intense;The windows whitened, shutters closeLadies in crowds around her close,Phials of crystal scents enclose.Malignant fury they disclose,A curious interest discloseCommand me, darling, what you chooseWhen, wise at length, we seek reposeHer smile and maidenly repose,Do agitate his late repose.Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,But nowhere can she find repose,But better loved the soft reposeAnd where at last his bones reposeAlready crisp hoar frosts imposeYears to light rhyme themselves oppose,Of thankless friends the circle rose,Furious he from the table rose;(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,He enters. High the cork aroseAnd the conviction soon arose,Years have inclined me to stern prose,As many dinners I rehearse,Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,Too much I'm given to intersperse,They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,That for that matter in my verseAnd also that my feeble verseAlthough we read him heaps of verse.Or ice and flame, are not diverseRound which revolves the universe.Within his sledge the stiffened corse,The speech of man and tramp of horse.Most usually a Cossack horseLoud paws the earth each panting horse,Detecting him the passing horseDeparted, ordered out his horseA fiery, yet well-broken horse,In age the memory gets worse,Existence would not make a curse,At womankind he growled a curse,How dull you are this morning, nurse!Snorts, and his rider bends his courseOh, many a year hath run its courseAll visited him at first, of course;A dinner, whimsical each course,Of friends the grateful intercourseYe mothers also, caution use,One instrument for his own useI once forgot for your sweet causeI lift a warning voice becauseThe thirst for fame and mans applause,Whose memory doth not refuseThe foaming Lenski would refuse,Now I am ready to refuse.But look youah! do not refuse.With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,Poetic transport did infuse,Ideas, desires and woes confuseThe monsters of the British MuseNow for the first time I my MuseIncited by his stormy MuseBut I the products of my Muse,But I must now employ my MuseA mournful temper on his Muse.Admirer of the peaceful Muse,What can be drearier than the house,Then became busy with the house,Received him freely at her house,Now, as in a deserted house,So hearken, every worthy spouse,Night separated from her spouse,Deplores a most unworthy spouseBesides the hobbies of a spouseThe drum already doth arouse.I would your vigilance arouse,To my old nurse alone peruse,Her steppe-like beauties I peruseConfess, O ye who this peruse,But what results? His eyes peruseBut Olga would not such peruse.They would not solemnly debateThey long ago had held debate.My famous portrait indicateBut this amusement delicateI marriednow, I supplicateTold me to ask you. Ere that dateThe Lovelaces are out of date,He was most gay. The happy dateAll this I know is out of date,Indifferent and sedate,That is, he could elucidateWill not, preserved by kindly Fate,The story of thy life and fate.The peasant blessed his happy fate.She muses: What was Olgas fate?On Lenskis matrimonial fateIndifferent was her future fate.Condemned to exile dire by fate,And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?Another time, so willed it Fate,Afar is borne by cruel fate,He nears a spacious mansions gate,The servants used to congregateTend not my heart to mitigate,The hostess doth interrogate:Your fashionable world I hate,By the coarse wit of worldly hate;Both were expectant of the hateWith her they did associate,Both were of passion satiateThe time for mystic strolls which lateThat year the autumn season lateShall surely, be it soon or late,He hath neglected us of late.Excruciate the heart and lateA promenade in twilight lateSometime collected, shall relate(Like other things I could relate)But tell me, nurse, can you relateBut if the truth I must relate,Desirous to annihilateIn charming fashion mutilate?How soon he learnt to titillateBut round the hostess scintillateTwo hearts perchance were desolateLongtime was her heart desolateBut now my mind is desolate,A mild quotation to translate,And you, O maids immaculate,Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;But I came not to adulate:The world enough. CongratulateAnd jests doth recapitulate.Reserved, but not inanimate,Conscious of death approximate,Just at the hour we designateAnd, joy of souls effeminate,By many a lamp illuminate,Sweet to behold him obstinate,Of life or death predestinate.I had found my predestinate,And stupid censors passionate;Perchance one more affectionate.He marmot-like did hibernate,And grasp a stirrup fortunateMust be pronounced unfortunateBut if my lot unfortunateTis fearful to anticipateBy time (who can anticipate?)To-day, my friends, at any rate,If but to lighten Times dull rate,By an _obroks_ indulgent rate:For evermore is separate.The Lrinas would celebrate,To whom your hearts were consecrate,To whom we used to consecrateThat chosen heroes consecrate,Her manners were deliberate,Spoiled children most degenerateBut merely to exasperate;You in the least commiserateOr Idol mio, and in the grateHis double sashes and his grate,When o'er a glass with friends we prateShifts, tacks about, until they prateIf cleverly or not I prate.Where turmoil cannot penetrate,The fatal bullet penetrate,Your frankness I shall compensateWith jealous fire resuscitate,On thee I used to meditate!Whom vice, if named, doth agitateThe matter did not agitate,Perchance some heart twill agitate,Eternally to imitateThese take their seats; the coach of stateThe secrets of the marriage stateThe sorrows of a single state.I am not strong enough to state;By rank as settled by the State.Tis sweet the foe to aggravateMy heart of old would captivate.My soul I cannot renovateWrapt in oblivion complete,With unanimity complete,Without them Eugene is complete;Who the romance do not complete,Encountered punishment complete,The weary way still incomplete,In bud of promise incomplete,Around my stanzas incompleteMe?Yes! It is Tattianas fteNor yet her lip compressed did bite.When poets lachrymose reciteThe fervid poet would recite,Was certainly not eruditeWinter resigned her empire white,Though dazzling its effulgence white,Their insolence and waistcoats whiteNor sudden turned she red or white,Its ebullition foaming whiteHer house he enters, ghastly white,Grew like a lily pure and white,Beneath the table-cloth of white,All so distinct, and all so white!A bottle of a vintage whiteThe converse of the world polite,The girl in marriage they unite.Highways all Russia will uniteHappy who thereto can uniteTrembles upon my lips from spite,Nor even tears afford respite,I have endured without respite.A philosophic anchorite:She wanders aimless as a sprite,Who thrives this moment as I write,Serve who could neither read nor write.I would, my friends, inscriptions write,But I must add to what I writeBeyond this may attempt to write_.And madrigals I'm asked to write!And irritates the appetite.Whilst Eugene condescending quite,The vestibule finds empty quiteNor died nor lost his senses quite.For I myself was thirteen quite;By Olga stood, dejected quiteAt last is shrunk and withered quite?A Russian household simple quite,And town and friends forgotten quite.Affection how did you requite?Lenski his comrade did invite.Fond declarations they inviteOn innocent delights I dote,On balls I madly used to dote,I on my chosen hero dote;Twas then in valleys lone, remote,Your innocent and charming noteWith vale finish off a note;To purest love he tuned his noteShe heard of servant-maids the note,Or the delivery of a note.In spring-time, heard the cygnets noteA dagger, asterisk, or noteInterrogation to denote.When in simplicity ye wroteThe letter which Tattiana wrote.But Lenski madrigals ne'er wroteAnd an elegiac poem wrote.So let us to the ball-room haste,His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;Beyond the city-barriers haste.And the attendants called in haste.We must admit but little tasteMore satisfaction to her taste.All which in Paris eager taste,This anchorite amid his wasteAnd she despite herself would wasteAnd education runs to waste,And ease and fashionable waste,With this unpleasant _tte--tte_,Princesse, mon ange!Pachette!Subscribed, _toujours vous, Annette;_And the cast-iron statuetteWould lose his slippers or gazette.Device of rural minds acute!)In the beginning, cold and mute,From whose analysis minuteWhilst homeward by the nearest routeMy countrys honour and reputeNone could a trace of that impute,Her all in all did constitute;Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,From her my lips shall learn the tongueDid they not all the Russian tongueA wild enthusiastic tongue,Onegin knew enough, the rogueLatin is just now not in vogue,Her locks were of a golden hue,The heavens shone in deeper blue,Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;Her eyes were of cerulean blue,He racked his brains to find its clueAlas! my friend, no revenue!His vanity first let us piqueTis time to marry her, tis true,Thou also, my ideal true,Then, in the country, ist not true?No noveltyis it not true?Ah! it may be, affection trueI did not please you.

The river speedsThe Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,To bring behind: the triple steedsThe languid eye of love-sick maids,Are ye replaced by other maidsTattiana to a corner, bidsAnd gradually day unfolds.In winter, when Night longer holdsCapers applauds with clap of hands,Abuse their masters, rub their hands:Nor beauties of far distant landsHis son and mortgages his lands.Nor homage which the Muse demandsObedient to warm Springs commands.Thus in the earth the seed expandsWhere each young critic ready stands,The steed benumbed still pawing standsThe father scarcely understandsAnd care but little for its ends.With bated breath, around she bendsThe avalanche of snow first bends,At times my reason almost bends,Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,Then glittering in the sun descends.Tattiana from the hill descendsNo one my anguish comprehends,Triumphstheir own or those of friendsThe voice of lovers, foes and friends,The feet of my dear lady friends.Of frivolous existence, friends;I've had to make for having friends!Existence without wife or friends,Against my inclination, friends,But little warmth the fireplace lends,Their harmless conversation blendsThe deuce take friends, my friends, amendsHis hate by slander, and who spendsOn us beyond the grave attends,With love which happiness extends;O feet, whereer your path extendsSits by her gloomily, desponds,Scarce to her questions he responds,The girl on tiptoe forward boundsAnd her voice sweeter than the soundsAppear attuned to softer chords;At least their accents and their wordsAnd wild among them grew her wordsOf passion reminiscences,Its cold unfeeling sentences;Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,My goddesses, where are your shades?The remnant destiny concedes,Tattiana motionless abides.Adieu! thou home where peace abides,The unbidden guests he roughly chidesLeisurely through the gateway glides.In scarlet cap revolving glides.And supercilious dames she glides,A crab upon a spider rides,Sits down and gazes on all sidesOf migratory gipsy hordesMoscow approach on bended knees,Whom autocratic fates decreesMay be that I by heavens decreesTo understand by slow degreesThe serpent to unlawful treesBeneath acacias, cherry-trees,The courtyard full of serfs he sees,Not the least trace Onegin seesBut now, what wretched roads one sees,And nothing more important sees;Like Horace, planted cabbages,She fears and like an arrow rushesOf thirty different sorts, lo! brushesBrambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,Both for the nails and for the tushes.Who dreams expound and prophecies.And all thy precious elegies,Around the garden homeward hies.And overcome antipathiesThe shutters open; to the skiesOf the moon in the tranquil skies,But lonely beneath Finnish skiesWhere all upon the surface lies,When the same life before him liesA sportsman who in covert lies.Amy Petrovna utters lies,Tattiana to the index fliesSlumber still o'er him lingering flies.Look through the window and kill flies.From hall to yard and garden flies,Oerwhelmed with guests; by familiesLamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,And to the Bourse the cabman plies;What mores required? The world replies,Ever to hear the same repliesAll breathless and without replies.Luceria Lvovna paint applies,His friends and also enemiesHad come both friends and enemiesThe general who accompanies.And the bad book accompanies.To bear loves parching agoniesThrice happy who their agoniesOh! who her speechless agoniesAlarmed by jealous agonies:Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg piesShe from the winter corn espiesSome a mazurka occupies,Tis silent all! Alone the criesHe roars, and Ah! Tattiana cries.Upon those pages she descriesEven the rosy wafer driesPast palaces and nunneries,In the worlds mortal revelries,With raspberries, cherries.And pelt him with cherries,To peer into the future tries.And alphabetically triesTo watch with lovers ecstasies,From public and from private ties,My splendid house and gaietiesThan cold Onguines oddities,At neighbouring hospitalities.And fashions gay frivolities;The gilding of life's vanities,I yield for splendid vanities,Who glory, wealth and dignitiesSpared him not their asperities.The country hath its libertiesUpon her tongue which fever bakes.And in her grasp the letter shakes,Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,The doors swing open: Lenski makesThe guests make room; aside each takesHe now a full possession takes,Without grammatical mistakes.The third at night. Tattiana wakesMay be, and this my terror wakes,The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,Or else (I deal not here in jokes),His recent glory he invokes.Also, to equalise the scales,Time, I invoke thee! favouring galesShe got a book of nursery tales,The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,Tis not so now. Like gentle damesEnclosing pictures of fair dames.But lights incendiary flamesAnd the dark fringe of men, like framesAnd jolting jarred the window-frames.To banish far unworthy themesTo whom ye for unnumbered crimesI sail upon my lake at timesAnd the young revellers of past timesAlas! he loved as in our timesAnd due precautions take betimes.And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,Whom pale Dianas ray illumesThe fishers fire afar illumesMad spirit of the man who rhymesHad to compose in secret rhymes,Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,Beside the cup she sang her rhymesAttentive be unto my rhymesBeneath the moon which dimly shines,And an enchanting shoulder shinesHer head upon her breast declinesUpon her elbow she reclines,Longer the East inert reclinesUpward in a thin stream inclines.Wherein love innocently pines.The golden ember now enshrines,And fashionable magazines,Arouse yourselves, fair ones.Yes! every one must have his foes,Now, like hereditary foes,And now he views forgotten foes,Winter! The peasant blithely goesStraight from the ball to bed he goes,Into the tangled garden goesEsteemed him much as the world goes.And meditative homeward goes,All arise. To the door he goes.All vanished as an echo goes.Between the stalls, along the toes;The accents wild of others woes,But nought for this Tattiana cares.With hisses Cleopatra scares,He fixedly upon her staresThe husband comes and interferesThe wondrous host of heavenly spheresAnd thus ancestral dust reveres.Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,Imaginations sacred fires,As with innumerable fires.And youthful madness, youthful fires.And still the coachmen round the firesWhite Moscow raises her old spires,Forgive the fever youth inspires,Compassion now or wrath inspiresAnd where tempestuous loves desires,And now his youthful heart desiresAnd of the irksome harness tires,Jackdaws on every spirein scores.Seated, a curious look with glassesShouts of applause! Onegin passesIn true interpretation hates:And slowly life coagulatesWhich in your spirit dominates,Nor in his dreams anticipatesBut wretched who anticipates,Cards, balls, routs, poetry or ftes;A trouble fell upon the sprites;_Quecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,And what like menaces fatigues,Which shines with iridescent hues.Her bosom heaves whilst crimson huesBy poor Tattiana in the blues;For ever carps, condemns, pursues?A victim decked with golden leaves;All which caprice and affluence craves,Across the Baltics salt sea waves,Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,And pallid nature trembling grieves,Who dressing-gown and slippers givesDescends, the order Guillot gives,Thus our light race grows up and lives,He enters: to the mill he drives:The appointed hour arrives, arrives!He rings in haste; in haste arrivesBeats that of friends and relatives:Our liberty at least survives:She the acquaintances she loves,To the pianoforte he movesHer spacious fields and shady groves,And various chords upon it proves,Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,Where every day before his eyesTo dreams I long have closed mine eyes,Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,Sudden she stops, casts down her eyesOlga he sees before his eyesOf frantic laughter, and all eyesNot daring to cast back her eyes.For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,But wide Tattiana oped her eyesBut finally he oped his eyesBefore her straight with roguish eyes.At the same hour she oped her eyesAnd truffles, dear to youthful eyes,His travels like all other thingsFor tallow, wood and other things_The peasants there are rich as kings,But still remembrance to him clings,Disperse yourselves, darlings,Happy and glorious_. But this bringsAll this in many cases bringsAll that industrial London bringsBrilliant, ethereal, there springsAnd now she skips and now she springsObedient to the magic strings,With late repentance gnaws and stings.Slow circling round its fellow swingsThe time between the wolf and dogsHow pleasantly the evening jogsSecret excursions made in sleighs;Along the Nevas bank he sleighs,Tattiana moans and now she sighsGoddess of lovers tender sighs.Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!Exceptionless as no rule is,And deem the world perfection is!Calmly her eyes encounter hisEugene, more tolerant than thisI just hint, in parenthesis,If ye but knew how dreadful tisWho with the Spanish envoy speaks?Lo, the ambassador who speaksBut yet Terpsichore bespeaksBetimes, and sees, when morning breaks,The old man who has had his freaks,Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,Go hear the rustling of the oaksHowever, the mazurka lacksFor the first time the hammer clicks.And terrify a swarm of ducks,Dianas bosom, Floras cheeks,The princes eye Onegin seeks:He who hath lived and living, thinks,He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinksA horses hoofs she hearsShe shrinks!In the meantime her spirit sinks,But nowmy very blood congeals,Was the meek love a maiden feels.Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compelsMay yet be studious of his nails;And beckon to the passing sails.Custom the despot soon prevails.The early tinkling of the bellsWhich of approaching labour tellsWhen the sonorous Brguet tellsPast women, sentry-boxes, rolls,Impelled by Springs dissolving beams,Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.To agitate me in my dreams.Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,He perished. Where his troubled dreams,For rural solitude and dreams,Do we foresee in troubled dreamsAnd where Thalia softly dreamsAnd the hearts agitated dreams.Descended swift in turbid streamsAnd where the admirable streamsThis wicked, that absurd he deems,This nonsense, that dishonest seems,Their memory lingers still and seemsBarely to draw her breath she seems,Awhile sound conversation seemsAnd heedless of approval seems,Or, when anew all Nature teems,Glory with which our history teemsAnd more imagination teems.Of conversation, thought and aimsWhere harsh frivolity proclaimsNo gift she bears, no feast proclaims,When evening o'er the landscape looms,In Olgas and Tattianas roomsA windmill too a jig performsAnd wildly waves its arms and storms;In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.Doctors and women, sobs and groans.Young maidens, fair maidens,The secrets of maidens.The frolics of maidens.Disport yourselves, maidens,Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,Insensible her hand remainsHis kneeling posture he retainsTo secrets of virgins,Friends and companions,Barking, young ladies osculations,Priams of country populationsAnd dames of fine organisations,Old peoples simple conversationsTheir offsprings innocent flirtationsLatest arrivals salutations,They were the wonderful traditionsProphecies, threats and apparitions,Had finished life amid his sons,For baseness of the spirit scorns,With blunted pencil-point adorns.Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,With flame more ardent passion burns,Her heart importunately turns.But to Onegin! _A propos!_All covered up with snow in heaps,Its stamping, capers and high leaps.In country towns, where still it keepsTis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.A little virgin mirror peeps.And lonely through the forest creeps.I will not wed, and ever weepsThe house is crammed. A thousand lampsImpatiently the gallery stamps,Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,Behold! beside their dwelling groupsWith smiling face he Lenski hears;Without participation hears,The two friends compliments she hearsThe silent fields no peasant nears,Although the destined coffin nears,With his ferocious mate appears.Tattiana in the yard appearsShe calm and unconcerned appears.Nearer they comeEugene appears!Mournful Loves deadly trace appearsFaithless, alas! thy maid appears,Distracted by her grief appearsAnd what from its recess appears?All in the good old style appears,The aged mother, bathed in tears,Not, and a flood of bitter tearsMy poor Vladimir, bitter tearsLikewise an epitaph with tearsHer sacred hoard of joy and tears,Her weary eyes are filled with tearsAnd to these letters and these tears.Her cap of tulle still ever wears:With Eugene pranks of former yearsThe solstice of our earthly years,(So twas with us in former years,For visions of my childish yearsFor dolls, een from her earliest years,Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,Have shone as one of fashions leaders.Onegin, O my gentle readers,Should recompense his idle jeers,But foolstheir calumnies and sneersOld age through spectacles too peers,The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,And judgment which unsteady veersTattiana certainly infersThe hamlet, the poor villagers,She ne'er repeated unto hers.If his hot hand encountered hers,Her garden, and those books of hers,Epicurean philosophers,Boulevards, belfries, milliners,Nor almanacs nor newspapers,Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepersSpring summons you to her green bowers,Youth freshens beneath Passions showers,Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;Of Levshins school ye followers,Develops and matures its powers,Nor boston nor the worlds affairsSaucepans and mattresses and chairs,To the theatre he repairsHe to the festival repairs,Tis day, the family downstairs,But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,A moment effervescing stirs,Balconies, lions heads on doors,And hated casual visitors,And the kind-hearted servitors:With one paw strokes her face and purrs,And where a madrigal occursTo swathe her shoulders in the furs,Judge then what roses would be ours,I see you weep. Those tears of yoursDreaming of what not, pretty lass,The manners of the highest classAnd breathes upon the chilly glass,Would loiter by the looking-glass,By bee and butterfly which pass.Both day and night he now must passAnd lo! five paces more they pass,And from his dressing-room would passUnseen in thick and tangled grassDivinity without accessYet satiated with success,There was no angling for success.In the worlds vortex my success,Trembling he seeks the young princessTattiana in the young princess!But the indifferent princess,Thus oftthis I myself confessEntreaties, woes and prayers, confessAnd now, I mournfully confess,How flourish, why and wherefore lessMe your perfections would not bless;If the domestic hearth could blessAlso their feetyet neerthelessWith fir-trees standing motionlessSpeech was so tame and colourlessWas famous for thick-headedness.To loiter there in idlenessMen become friends from idleness.Love, flowers, the country, idlenessHer heart how full of gentleness,A child devoid of childishnessTattiana finds in loneliness.In melancholy loveliness,Her cheek of rosy lovelinessAnd contemplative dreaminess;Twas possible then, happinessOr, strange to me is happiness?Oppressive now is happiness,He _cannot_ give me happiness.By Heaven in lieu of happiness.But strange am I to happiness;With laughter smothered weariness:Their slander een was weariness;In old age life is weariness!And freezing fits of weariness.All sons of mental weariness.This glitter, riot, emptiness,Amid the awful emptinessIn rhyming I show laziness.Attractive in its banefulness?I murmur not! Why mournfulness?I thank thee for thy joyfulness,Where my days in the wildernessWith spiritual tenderness;Inspired by whom this tenderness,Aroused in him some tenderness.The bays of age and helplessness.My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessnessIs it that human restlessnessOnegin, all this sumptuousness,Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?Whose hands indulgently caressThose whom we ought to love, caress,Await the long-delayed caress.To array himself in evening dress.The ladies, their fantastic dress,Or kiss the border of her dress.Nor dares the skirting of her dressMeantime in matutinal dressHer eyes no saucy glance address,Conquer by passion and address,She hears the bear behind her press,Her feet the earth beneath her press!But Eugene long hath left the pressA young Armidas lips to press,Wherefore regarding him expressTo fawn upon and love express;She starts, nor doth a word express,I like the difference to expressAll that the heart would fain expressDally with a dishevelled tressNor discontinued to distressLoves tender transports and distress,Inflict annoyance and distressHymens embarrassments, distress,Her agitation and distressHabit was given us in distressAnd though I read it with distress,Tattianas letter I possess,If wife and children to possessIf the raw product they possessA strong resemblance these possessThis gentle daring who could guess?Her nurse, who could have made a guess,Could not in that brief moment guess!Alas! It is not hard to guess.The uncontaminated kissHave felt loves agitated kissBeneath his lips devouring kiss.A ladys hand doth never kiss.With tears, confused emotions, bliss,This evanescent boyish bliss.Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,In thee, thou world of empty bliss.Even amusing fools we missBut how? Quite so. Though I dismissCan count the time without much fussBeside the thundering abyssEverywhere trumpeting its feats,Again the giddy waltz repeats.As every journal now entreats,Soon the maid on a chair he seats,And stay whose length none recollects.In the meantime the mill inspects.Their coming which no man expects,Leaning against the dam expects,Of slumbering citizens he fleets,Whom latterly one often meetsThough without palaces and streets,Past darkened windows and long streetsAlong Saint Petersburgs paved streets,Not seeking love but sensual sweets.Delicious visions, jests and fights!Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,The fire of the nocturnal lights;And oh! what verses, what delights,Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,With rapturous longing he awaits,Will teach grammatical conceits,As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,And his poor basten sandal knits.The maiden at her casement sitsAs formerly the shepherd sitsWith cherries, red currants,Its splendour and its blandishments,But, after mutual compliments,The epistle from the bard presents.She visited the humble tentsThe hours once more Onegin counts,But ten strikes and his sledge he mountsA rivulet beneath them shootsTwo pines have joined their tangled roots,To Olga Petoushkova darts:Ever receive with kindly heartsThe flimsy wares of Western marts,We Russians, friends from distant partsThe Paris of those country partsMeantime a Cyclops of those partsBaratynski (_Feasts_)Deliberate approach of guestsVariety of speech and vests,Who labours hard to humour us?Well! Lrina appears to usUs, and like Trojan warriors slay us;The stomach doth admonish us.And like Napoleons each of usThough for his Helen MenelausA million bipeds reckons thusCorneilles majestic genius,Whereto in language courteousYea! although rendered beauteousAnd gloomy epigrams malicious.A critic of the stage malicious,A slave of actresses capricious,To witticisms and taunts half-viciousThe conversation tediousOh! who is not calumnious?There Didelot became glorious,She seemed of him oblivious,By such allusions scandalous,With satisfaction marvellous,By Tolstoys pencil marvellous,And tiresome rogues ridiculousHow mean, how pusillanimous!Amid sly, pusillanimousThe drive becomes monotonousFeeling is silly, dangerous.Thou also, reader generous,Then ye were barely generous,It was a cheery, generousHe shunned those parties boisterous;Abandon cities riotous,Come sing we in chorusThe friend of liberty and lawsI long have ceased to offend the laws.Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,The tightened leathern rein she draws,Perverse, unfavourable views?His watch, the sun in turn he viewsAnd through the lofty windows viewsTo male acquaintances he bows,The men salute with lower bowsWith all dissatisfaction shows.The epitaph on marble shows:Misunderstanding, words and blows.Mends with the Russian hammers blowsAnd Comet champagne foaming flows.When Passions fire no longer glowsBefore a fire which feebly glowsAmber on pipes from Stamboul glows,And this the faithful one allows,Profiles of lovely dames he knowsFor otherwiseGod only knows!And all the joys which Winter knows.Upon the dreary northern snows,The first appearance of the snowsHis pony sniffing the fresh snowsThrough dense aristocratic rowsFrom boxes or from stalls in rows.The connoisseur his glances throwsOn unknown female forms he throws.Oer hillock and o'er meadow throws.Enjoy the meed which Fame bestowsWe called to mind our youthful daysTo vary for a few brief days.The very morning of our days.That vanished are my youthful daysO triumphs of my guileless days,Of fiery youths untutored daysMoscow, how oft in evil days,Companion of my childhoods days.As partner of my mournful days,As the sins of my youthful daysAnd then to meditate for daysAlas! the friend of childish daysBut even thus not now-a-days!And I confess that now-a-daysOr Bogdanovitchs sweet lays.In one of thine enchanting laysConsisting of harmonious lays,Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,On the blue blocks of ice the raysNo more with pale Dianas rays,Her hand for the cotillon prays.With which blind Fortune oft betraysNor interest in aught betrays.Alas! my stomach it betraysWhen he in ardent verse portraysOnegin his excuses says;Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;Till the mazurkas close he stays,Streams excavate subaqueous ways,Or parody of modern ways?Delighted much his former waysBut soon she altered all her ways,And hates the worlds discordant ways.Unto Anicia for the keysThe household troop of little boys,A joyous troop of little boysWho cannot conjure former joys?Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,Approach not to gaze atUnless forbidden fruit we eat,She gazed thereon, and instant beatEre this but one brief moment beatThere the confusion, pressure, heat,And boiling o'er with friendly heat,Age immature averse to cheatNurses who scream and babes who bleat.With lovers rubbish filled, was neatWhich lessons unto us repeat,The passionate speeches I'll repeat,Now all things round about repeatI mean my name not to repeat.I might to connoisseurs repeatDo not cold-bloodedly repeatAnd in a whisper did repeat:A hundred times will not repeat,And cry: he was a poet great!And at economy was great;Alone amid possessions great,A ball here, there a childrens treat,When in the studys calm retreat,On this artistical retreatOf woods and fields the calm retreat,Till out of breath upon a seatRemoved her to his country seat,Happy who quit life's banquet seatAbandoned he his country seat,No misery I see in thatBegins to talk of this and that,Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,Upon my lake I love to float,But when two minutes she had sat,My friend, tis but to pay a debt,Her brow she did not een contractAnd blush to own himself reflect.With so much warmth and intellect?Of keen sarcastic intellectWhere I can no more recollect?Two verses he could recollectThe perfidies I recollectSo prudent, and so circumspectShould make me much more circumspect,The glass unwittingly inspectSuch am I. This did ye expect,And Christian folk will, I expect,An inn at every stage erect.The disenchanted glass directSo full of piety, correct,Of the neid, but incorrect.Herein my portrait should detect,Faithfully shall I now depict,Wherein the child of fashion strictYoung ladies faces and their feet.Three pairs of handsome female feet;Long ago, prostrate at her feet.Eugene fell prostrate at her feetBut nowwhat brings you to my feet?Bows and the scrape of many feet,Are oft deceptivelike their feet.And rapid whirl of many feet,A heavy goose on scarlet feet,Her heart more loudly and more fleet.Where fashionable circles meetThe miserable bard to meet,The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,O Brenta, once more we shall meetAnd watch her eyes full glance to meet.Your magic voices I shall greet,Her with a smile old women greet,But staggers, slips, and falls. We greetNear Kharitons in a side streetTo whom is it to go, my sweet?The words and looks of charmers sweetThat my coy Muse might sing more sweet.That heart with inspiration sweetOur paradise is no more sweet.Look quickly to your left, my sweet!Ceaselessly to the maiden sweetAs hope uncertain and as sweet,And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;Wherein I castigation get;But time flies and she doth forgetAh! I still struggle to forgetBeside a nameless rivulet,And by that shady rivuletWithout enthusiasm he metWhere God alone knows whom she met.When in her walks abroad she metThe hour whenFate so willedwe metOf one thing till again we met.Then in the silent cabinetOf widow Clicquot or MoetThy dove, thy darling little petThe landscape which the moonbeams fret,Tortured by pangs of wild regret,The fair, nor parted with regret,My friends, the poet ye regret!On whom a sisters heart was setOf every sort and every set!Ere the bright messenger had set.A simple tombstone hath been set.And wean unattractive setIt will be by a mob besetWhilst on the floor Monsieur TriquetWhere in the country Eugene yet,Onegin, hast forgotten yetMid worldly pleasures chased him yet,Hath she found out the riddle yet?For twice you came to them and yetThen amongst strangers I was leftWell nigh her heart in twain was cleft.Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,Of consolation all bereftWho secretly denounced the gift,Though deep he sinks into the drift;Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,Raises within my breast as oftAnd by the world repeated oft,Born of a babbler in a loftSpeech careless, incorrect, but soft,But from the Muses loftiest heightIn vehicles surcharged with freight;And hurried home his awful freight.China and bronze the tables weight,To many a noisy feast and fight,That, tipsy once in actual fight,I with my friend intend to fight!In bullets, sabres, and in fight.Eight times the heroes of the fightCartel, or challenge to a fight,Above the yawning grave would fight,Yet clearer shines than every lightWas younger than myself, my light,Was withered ere the morning lightThere came a sudden flash of light,The ladies dresses airy, light,The firmament in mellow light,The crowd and merriment and light,That the two friends with mornings lightPour on this orb a dazzling lightOr but for fame he saw the light;Of sunset glow with rosy light,Like Hippocrene it scatters light,Could not eclipse her neighbours light.By liberties or loose or light.But wilful, frivolous, and light.But lo! already the moons lightBlest be the labours of the light,Auroras ruddy rays of lightAs a babes slumber, or the lightArising with the mornings light,And showed with an uncertain lightAll about Olgato a lightOur hero stops and doth alight,_Who in thy love finds more delightWhen tea was brought. Tis my delightTo find in gossip such delight,They will receive us with delight.The votary of vain delightThe Muse revealed her first delight,The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!The curse of commonplace delight.My pen no longer finds delight,In such an album with delightIn my young days of wild delightI love its furious delight,His spirit sank with strange delight.His ardent soul with full delight.He finally lost all delightEen for an instant find delight,Contemplativeness, her delight,But death from him will be delight.A sense of social delight,And with emotional delightAnd solitude and calm delight.And solitude and calm delight,And full of innocent delight,And bless mankind with full delight.And like the prisoners our delightAh! brethren, what was my delightAbandoning insane delight,And Schiller read by candlelight.Having remarked Vladimirs flight,From you too Eugene took to flight,But, ere he mounts the marble flight,And swifter than the swallows flight.An ever transcendental flight;His care unto his pistols plight,Her movements, voice and figure slight,Time was, a valiant general mightThe china teapot too ye mightResounding through all ages mightIf in the scenes of home I mightAnd be as happyas I might.The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.The moon, the stars, and shining nightThe altar flame was quenched in night.That glimmered through the radiant nightTerror of guardians of the night;Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,Outside descend the mists of night.Lay languishing both day and nightHow oft, when on a summer nightFull many a lovely star hath nightFrom her half-open vest of night.Delighted.When?This very night.But turning morning into night,And glasses unemployed all night;And blest the shadows of the night.And breathe the balmy breath of night;So there will be a dance to-night.My morning birdie, yesternightParis and Menelaus right.In the first place, say, am I right?And form a network left and right;And better, if I judge aright;All this, my friends, translate aright:When I yon semicircle brightWas it not thou, O vision bright,Twas dusk!

GloomilyMute, solemn, frowning gloomily.And like Childe Harold gloomilyAnd the far mountains daintilyTerror assails her.

My uncles goodness is extreme,
If seriously he hath disease;
He hath acquired the worlds esteem
And nothing more important sees;
A paragon of virtue he!
But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
A dying man with art to soothe,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And physic bring with mournful face,
To sigh and meditate alone:
When will the devil take his own!
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Inheritor of all his race.
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Let me present ye to the man,
Who without more prevarication
The hero is of my narration!
Onegin, O my gentle readers,
Was born beside the Neva, where
It may be ye were born, or there
Have shone as one of fashions leaders.
I also wandered there of old,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
Having performed his service truly,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
At last became a ruined man.
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
For first madame his wants observed,
And then monsieur supplied her place;
The boy was wild but full of grace.
Monsieur lAbb a starving Gaul,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Morality taught scarce at all;
Gently for pranks he would reprove
And in the Summer Garden rove.
When youths rebellious hour drew near
And my Eugene the path must trace
The path of hope and tender fear
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Lo! my Onegin free as air,
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The giddy world at last shall see.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In the French language perfectly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
What mores required? The world replies,
He is a charming youth and wise.
We all of us of education
A something somehow have obtained,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
With us is easily attained.
Onegin was so many deemed,
Pedantic although scholar like,
In truth he had the happy trick
Without constraint in conversation
Of touching lightly every theme.
Silent, oracular yet see him
Amid a serious disputation,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
The ladies laughter to provoke.
Latin is just now not in vogue,
But if the truth I must relate,
Onegin knew enough, the rogue
A mild quotation to translate,
A little Juvenal to spout,
With vale finish off a note;
Two verses he could recollect
Of the neid, but incorrect.
In history he took no pleasure,
The dusty chronicles of earth
For him were but of little worth,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Within his memory there lay,
From Romulus unto our day.
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Existence would not make a curse,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
And at economy was great;
That is, he could elucidate
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
If the raw product they possess
The medium is required of gold.
The father scarcely understands
His son and mortgages his lands.
But upon all that Eugene knew
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But say he was a genius who
In one thing really did excel.
It occupied him from a boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
It whiled his idle hours away
And wholly occupied his day
The amatory science warm,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
For which the poet agonized
Laid down his life of sun and storm
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Far from his Italyhis own.
How soon he learnt deceptions art,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Obsequious or indifferent!
What languor would his silence show,
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How artless was the note which spoke
Of love again, and yet again;
How deftly could he transport feign!
How bright and tender was his look,
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Would at the proper time appear.
How well he played the greenhorns part
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Sometimes by pleasing flatterys art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
The feeble moment would espy
Of tender years the modesty
Conquer by passion and address,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Avowal then twas time to pray,
Attentive to the hearts first beating,
Follow up lovea secret meeting
Arrange without the least delay
Then, thenwell, in some solitude
Lessons to give he understood!
How soon he learnt to titillate
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
Desirous to annihilate
His own antagonists expert,
How bitterly he would malign,
With many a snare their pathway line!
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
With him were friends eternally:
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And the suspicious veteran old,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Who floats contentedly through life,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
His valet brings him letters three.
What, invitations? The same day
As many entertainments be!
A ball here, there a childrens treat,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither shall he go first? Hell see,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Meantime in matutinal dress
And hat surnamed a Bolivar
He hies unto the Boulevard,
To loiter there in idleness
Until the sleepless Brguet chime
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Drive on! the cheerful cry goes forth,
His furs are powdered on the way
By the fine silver of the north.
He bends his course to Talons, where
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He enters. High the cork arose
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Before him red roast beef is seen
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
To cool the cutlets seething grease,
When the sonorous Brguet tells
Of the commencement of the piece.
A critic of the stage malicious,
A slave of actresses capricious,
Onegin was a citizen
Of the domains of the side-scene.
To the theatre he repairs
Where each young critic ready stands,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
Moina recalls for this alone
That all may hear his voices tone.
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Shone pungent Satires dauntless king,
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
The young Simeonova too there
With Ozeroff was wont to share
Applause, the peoples donative.
There our Katnine did revive
Corneilles majestic genius,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
His comedies, a noisy rout,
There Didelot became glorious,
There, there, beneath the side-scenes shade
The drama of my youth was played.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Are ye replaced by other maids
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Russias Terpsichore review
Again in her ethereal dance?
Or will my melancholy glance
On the dull stage find all things changed,
The disenchanted glass direct
Where I can no more recollect?
A careless looker-on estranged
In silence shall I sit and yawn
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Obedient to the magic strings,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
With one foot resting on its tip
Slow circling round its fellow swings
And now she skips and now she springs
Like down from Aeoluss lip,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Shouts of applause! Onegin passes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Seated, a curious look with glasses
On unknown female forms he throws.
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
With all dissatisfaction shows.
To male acquaintances he bows,
And finally he deigns let fall
Upon the stage his weary glance.
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Exclaiming, We must change em all!
I long by ballets have been bored,
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still everywhere, without, within,
The lamps illuminating shine;
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
And of the irksome harness tires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
But Eugene long hath left the press
To array himself in evening dress.
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Portray the solitary den
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
All that industrial London brings
For tallow, wood and other things
Across the Baltics salt sea waves,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
Choosing a profitable trade,
For our amusement ever made
And ease and fashionable waste,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Dared calmly cleanse his nails fore him,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,
The friend of liberty and laws
In this case quite mistaken was.
The most industrious man alive
May yet be studious of his nails;
What boots it with the age to strive?
Custom the despot soon prevails.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Dreading the worlds remarks malign,
Was that which we are wont to call
A fop, in dress pedantical.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Like Venus when, capriciously,
The goddess would a masquerade
Attend in male attire arrayed.
On this artistical retreat
Having once fixed your interest,
I might to connoisseurs repeat
The style in which my hero dressed;
Though I confess I hardly dare
Describe in detail the affair,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
To Russ indigenous are not;
And also that my feeble verse
Pardon I ask for such a sin
With words of foreign origin
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
Though to the Academy I come
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
But such is not my project now,
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Past darkened windows and long streets
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Which shines with iridescent hues.
He nears a spacious mansions gate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
And through the lofty windows views
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And also fashionable beaux.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Flies past the porter to the stair,
But, ere he mounts the marble flight,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
No more the music thunders loud,
Some a mazurka occupies,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
And following them ye might espy
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And by the fiddles rushing sound
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
In my young days of wild delight
On balls I madly used to dote,
Fond declarations they invite
Or the delivery of a note.
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And due precautions take betimes.
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Employ your glasses constantly,
For otherwiseGod only knows!
I lift a warning voice because
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
I've wasted in amusements vain,
But were it not immoral I
Should dearly like a dance again.
I love its furious delight,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Also their feetyet neertheless
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Their memory lingers still and seems
To agitate me in my dreams.
When, where, and in what desert land,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
No trace ye left in passing by
Upon the dreary northern snows,
But better loved the soft repose
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and mans applause,
My country and an exiles lot;
My joy in youth was fleeting een
As your light footprints on the green.
Dianas bosom, Floras cheeks,
Are admirable, my dear friend,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Charms more enduring in the end.
For promises her feet reveal
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Their privileged allurements fire
A hidden train of wild desire.
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
In winter on the fender bright,
In springtime on the meadows green,
Upon the ball-rooms glassy floor
Or by the oceans rocky shore.
Beside the stormy sea one day
I envied sore the billows tall,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
How like the billow I desired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
No, never in the early blaze
Of fiery youths untutored days
So ardently did I desire
A young Armidas lips to press,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Or bosom full of languid fire,
A gust of passion never tore
My spirit with such pangs before.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
And grasp a stirrup fortunate
Her foot was in my other hand.
Again imagination blazed,
The contact of the foot I raised
Rekindled in my withered heart
The fires of passion and its smart
Away! and cease to ring their praise
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Of passion they so often raise.
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Are oft deceptivelike their feet.
Where is Onegin? Half asleep,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
The drum already doth arouse.
The shopman and the pedlar rise
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
The shutters open; to the skies
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
The German baker looks around
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
But turning morning into night,
Tired by the balls incessant noise,
The votary of vain delight
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
When the same life before him lies
Till mornlife uniform but gay,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
But was our friend Eugene content,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Amidst successes flattering
And pleasures daily blandishment,
Or vainly mid luxurious fare
Was he in health and void of care?
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Nor long his mind was agitated
By loves inevitable flame.
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Because he could not gourmandise
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
And irrigate them with champagne;
Nor slander viciously could spread
Wheneer he had an aching head;
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
He finally lost all delight
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
His malady, whose cause I ween
It now to investigate is time,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Transported to our Russian clime.
It gradually possessed his mind;
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Indifferent he became to all,
And like Childe Harold gloomily
He to the festival repairs,
Nor boston nor the worlds affairs
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Impressed him in the least degree,
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
He left _you_ first, and I must own
The manners of the highest class
Have latterly vexatious grown;
And though perchance a lady may
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Then theyre so innocent of vice,
So full of piety, correct,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
So inaccessible to men,
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Whom latterly one often meets
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Along Saint Petersburgs paved streets,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Abandoning insane delight,
And isolated from all men,
Yawning betook him to a pen.
He thought to write, but labour long
Inspired him with disgust and so
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
And thus he never fell among
That vicious set whom I dont blame
Because a member I became.
Once more to idleness consigned,
He felt the laudable desire
From mere vacuity of mind
The wit of others to acquire.
A case of books he doth obtain
He reads at random, reads in vain.
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
The moderns of the ancients rave
Books he abandoned like the fair,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
With taffety instead of crape.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Like him renouncing vanity,
His friendship I acquired just then;
His character attracted me.
An innate love of meditation,
Original imagination,
And cool sagacious mind he had:
I was incensed and he was sad.
Both were of passion satiate
And both of dull existence tired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Both were expectant of the hate
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
The very morning of our days.
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
Must een despise his kind at last;
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
From shades of the relentless past.
No fond illusions live to soothe,
But memory like a serpents tooth
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
All this in many cases brings
A charm with it in conversation.
Onguines speeches I abhorred
At first, but soon became inured
To the sarcastic observation,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
How oft, when on a summer night
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
The firmament in mellow light,
And when the watery mirror gleamed
No more with pale Dianas rays,
We called to mind our youthful days
The days of love and of romance!
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Impressionable for an hour,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And like the prisoners our delight
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
As on the rapid wings of thought
The early days of life we sought.
Absorbed in melancholy mood
And o'er the granite coping bent,
Onegin meditative stood,
Een as the poet says he leant.
Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Of the night sentinels arise
And from the Millionaya afar
The sudden rattling of a car.
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And now we hear delightedly
A jolly song and distant horn;
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Torquato Tassos strains I deem.
Ye billows of blue Hadrias sea,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
And, inspiration firing me,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Whose tones Apollos sons inspire,
And after Albions proud lyre
Possess my love and sympathy.
The nights of golden Italy
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Hid in the gondolas dark shade,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Now talkative, now reticent;
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
When will my hour of freedom come!
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Awaiting on the shore I roam
And beckon to the passing sails.
Upon the highway of the sea
When shall I wing my passage free
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
Tis time to quit this weary shore
So uncongenial to my mind,
To dream upon the sunny strand
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Wherein I felt loves fatal dart,
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Eugene designed with me to start
And visit many a foreign clime,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
For a protracted space of time.
Just at that time his father died,
And soon Onguines door beside
Of creditors a hungry rout
Their claims and explanations shout.
But Eugene, hating litigation
And with his lot in life content,
To a surrender gave consent,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Or counting on his uncles death
And what the old man might bequeath.
And in reality one day
The steward sent a note to tell
How sick to death his uncle lay
And wished to say to him farewell.
Having this mournful document
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
And hastened to his uncles side,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Having for moneys sake alone
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail
Thus we began our little tale
But, to his uncles mansion flown,
He found him on the table laid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
And from the country all around
Had come both friends and enemies
Funeral amateurs abound!
The body they consigned to rest,
And then made merry pope and guest,
With serious air then went away
As men who much had done that day.
Lo! my Onegin rural lord!
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
He who economy abhorred,
Delighted much his former ways
To vary for a few brief days.
For two whole days it seemed a change
To wander through the meadows still,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
To listen to the rippling rill.
But on the third of grove and mead
He took no more the slightest heed;
They made him feel inclined to doze;
And the conviction soon arose,
Ennui can in the country dwell
Though without palaces and streets,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or ftes;
On him spleen mounted sentinel
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Or better,like a faithful wife.
I was for calm existence made,
For rural solitude and dreams,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
And more imagination teems.
On innocent delights I dote,
Upon my lake I love to float,
For law I _far niente_ take
And every morning I awake
The child of sloth and liberty.
I slumber much, a little read,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
In former years thus did not I
In idleness and tranquil joy
The happiest days of life employ?
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
And fields my joys have ever been;
I like the difference to express
Between myself and my Eugene,
Lest the malicious reader or
Some one or other editor
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Herein my portrait should detect,
And impiously should declare,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
As if impossible it were
To write of any other elf
Than ones own fascinating self.
Here I remark all poets are
Love to idealize inclined;
I have dreamed many a vision fair
And the recesses of my mind
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
The captives of the Salguirs shore.
But now a question in this wise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
With tenderness hath recognized
Thy meditative incantation
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
None, be my witness Heaven above!
The malady of hopeless love
I have endured without respite.
Happy who thereto can unite
Poetic transport. They impart
A double force unto their song
Who following Petrarch move along
And ease the tortures of the heart
Perchance they laurels also cull
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
And my dark soul to light was brought;
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Of harmony enshrining thought.
I write, and anguish flies away,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Around my stanzas incomplete
Young ladies faces and their feet.
Extinguished ashes do not blaze
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Time will the ravages efface
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
To write in cantos twenty-five.
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
The heros name too in advance,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
Discovered much absurdity,
But will not modify a tittle
I owe the censorship a little.
For journalistic deglutition
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Go, on the Nevas bank appear,
My very latest composition!
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
O Rus!Horace
The village wherein yawned Eugene
Was a delightful little spot,
There friends of pure delight had been
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
The lonely mansion-house to screen
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Villages in the distance show
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
A thick immense neglected grove
Extendedhaunt which Dryads love.
Twas built, the venerable pile,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
In solid, unpretentious style,
The style of wise antiquity.
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Imperial portraits hang around
And stoves of various shapes abound.
All this I know is out of date,
I cannot tell the reason why,
But Eugene, incontestably,
The matter did not agitate,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
He took the room wherein the old
Manforty years long in this wise
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
Look through the window and kill flies.
Twas plainan oaken floor ye scan,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
Onegin oped the cupboards wide.
In one he doth accounts behold,
Here bottles stand in close array,
There jars of cider block the way,
An almanac but eight years old.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
No other book had time to read.
Alone amid possessions great,
Eugene at first began to dream,
If but to lighten Times dull rate,
Of many an economic scheme;
This anchorite amid his waste
The ancient _barshtchina_ replaced
By an _obroks_ indulgent rate:
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
But this a heinous crime appeared
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Who secretly denounced the gift,
And many another slily sneered;
And all with one accord agreed,
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
All visited him at first, of course;
But since to the backdoor they led
Most usually a Cossack horse
Upon the Dons broad pastures bred
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Hes a freemason, so we think.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
A ladys hand doth never kiss.
Tis _yes! no!_ never _madam! sir!_
This was his social character.
Into the district then to boot
A new proprietor arrived,
From whose analysis minute
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
From Gottingen inspired he came,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A young and handsome galliard.
He brought from mystic Germany
The fruits of learning and combined
A fiery and eccentric mind,
Idolatry of liberty,
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
The pervert world with icy chill
Had not yet withered his young breast.
His heart reciprocated still
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
He was a dear delightful fool
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
The riot of the world and glare
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
And by a sweet delusion he
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
He deemed of human life the goal
To be a charming mystery:
He racked his brains to find its clue
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
Impelled to union with his own
Lay languishing both day and night
Waiting his cominghis alone!
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Great sacrifices for his sake!
That a friends arm in every case
Felled a calumniator base!
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Existthat their immortal band
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And bless mankind with full delight.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now his youthful heart desires
The path which leads to glorys goal.
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
And at the altar of their fame
He kindled his poetic flame.
But from the Muses loftiest height
The gifted songster never swerved,
But proudly in his song preserved
An ever transcendental flight;
His transports were quite maidenly,
Charming with grave simplicity.
He sang of loveto love a slave.
His ditties were as pure and bright
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As a babes slumber, or the light
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Goddess of lovers tender sighs.
He sang of separation grim,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of roses to romancers dear;
To foreign lands he would allude,
Where long time he in solitude
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Before he eighteen years attained.
Since Eugene in that solitude
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
At neighbouring hospitalities.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
The conversation tedious
About the crop of hay, the wine,
The kennel or a kindred line,
Was certainly not erudite
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
A sense of social delight,
But still more stupid did appear
The gossip of their ladies fair.
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Lenski as a good match received,
Such is the country custom good;
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
He enters: rapidly discussion
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The sorrows of a single state.
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
The young proprietor we find;
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
And a guitar produced we see,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
_Come to my golden palace, dear_!
But Lenski, having no desire
Vows matrimonial to break,
With our Onegin doth aspire
Acquaintance instantly to make.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
If they were similar in aught.
At first such contradictions wrought
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
But grown familiar side by side
On horseback every day they ride
Inseparable soon they be.
Thus oftthis I myself confess
Men become friends from idleness.
But even thus not now-a-days!
In spite of common sense were wont
As cyphers others to appraise,
Ourselves as unities to count;
And like Napoleons each of us
A million bipeds reckons thus
One instrument for his own use
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
(Though certainly mankind he knew
And usually despised it too),
Exceptionless as no rule is,
A few of different temper deemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
The poets fervid conversation
And judgment which unsteady veers
And eye which gleams with inspiration
All this was novel to Eugene.
The cold reply with gloomy mien
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: tis foolish to disturb
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Time without me will lessons give,
So meantime let him joyous live
And deem the world perfection is!
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
The gulf between them was so vast,
Debate commanded ample food
The laws of generations past,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The prejudices all men have,
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And life and fate in turn selected
Were to analysis subjected.
The fervid poet would recite,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Fragments of northern poetry,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Though scarcely following what was said,
Attentive listened to the lad.
But more the passions occupy
The converse of our hermits twain,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
An exile from their troublous reign,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
By absence who hath chilled his love,
His hate by slander, and who spends
Existence without wife or friends,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Neer trusted to the treacherous ace.
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
When Passions fire no longer glows
And when her violence reviewed
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Reduced with effort unto sense,
We hear with interest intense
The accents wild of others woes,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
A curious interest disclose
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Lost in the hamlet far away.
And in addition youth is flame
And cannot anything conceal,
Is ever ready to proclaim
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
In loves campaigns Onegin heard
With quite a lachrymose expression
The youthful poets fond confession.
He with an innocence extreme
His inner consciousness laid bare,
And Eugene soon discovered there
The story of his young loves dream,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Which we experienced long ago.
Alas! he loved as in our times
Men love no more, as only the
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Is still condemned in love to be;
One image occupied his mind,
Constant affection intertwined
And an habitual sense of pain;
And distance interposed in vain,
Nor years of separation all
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
His constant soul could ever tire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
When but a boy he Olga loved
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Beneath the sheltering oak trees shade
He with his little maiden played,
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro life,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
And full of innocent delight,
As in a thickets humble shade,
Beneath her parents eyes the maid
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Twas she who first within his breast
Poetic transport did infuse,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Twas then he loved the tangled grove
And solitude and calm delight,
The moon, the stars, and shining night
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
To whom we used to consecrate
A promenade in twilight late
With tears which secret sufferers love
But now in her effulgence pale
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Obedient she had ever been
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
As a poetic life serene,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
All about Olgato a light
Romance of love I pray refer,
Youll find her portrait there, I vouch;
I formerly admired her much
But finally grew bored by her.
But with her elder sister I
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Tattiana was her appellation.
We are the first who such a name
In pages of a love narration
With such a perversity proclaim.
But wherefore not?Tis pleasant, nice,
Euphonious, though I know a spice
It carries of antiquity
And of the attic. Honestly,
We must admit but little taste
Doth in us or our names appear
(I speak not of our poems here),
And education runs to waste,
Endowing us from out her store
With affectation,nothing more.
And so Tattiana was her name,
Nor by her sisters brilliancy
Nor by her beauty she became
The cynosure of every eye.
Shy, silent did the maid appear
As in the timid forest deer,
Even beneath her parents roof
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
To fawn upon and love express;
A child devoid of childishness
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Oft staring through the window pane
Would she in silence long remain.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Een from her cradles earliest dream,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Neer touched her fingers indolent
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
Would she the canvas tight enrich
With gay design and silken stitch.
Desire to rule ye may observe
When the obedient doll in sport
An infant maiden doth exhort
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Gravely repeating to another
Recent instructions of its mother.
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
For dolls, een from her earliest years,
And gossip of the town and fashion
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Strange unto her each childish game,
But when the winter season came
And dark and drear the evenings were,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
All the young people round about,
At prisoners base she never played.
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
She loved upon the balcony
To anticipate the break of day,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The starry beacons fade away,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Mornings forerunners, breezes blow
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Longer the East inert reclines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
And would by candlelight arise.
Romances pleased her from the first,
Her all in all did constitute;
In love adventures she was versed,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
In books he saw nought to condemn
But, as he never opened them,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
And gave himself but little pain
His daughters book to ascertain
Which neath her pillow lay till morn.
His wife was also mad upon
The works of Mr. Richardson.
She was thus fond of Richardson
Not that she had his works perused,
Or that adoring Grandison
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
But that Princess Pauline of old,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
The tale of these romantic men;
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
And she despite herself would waste
Sighs on another than her lord
Whose qualities appeared to afford
More satisfaction to her taste.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Like his, her dress was always nice,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
But contrary to her advice
The girl in marriage they unite.
Then, her distraction to allay,
The bridegroom sage without delay
Removed her to his country seat,
Where God alone knows whom she met.
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Night separated from her spouse,
Then became busy with the house,
First reconciled and then content;
Habit was given us in distress
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Habit alleviates the grief
Inseparable from our lot;
This great discovery relief
And consolation soon begot.
And then she soon twixt work and leisure
Found out the secret how at pleasure
To dominate her worthy lord,
And harmony was soon restored.
The workpeople she superintended,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
And all without her husbands leave.
In her friends albums, time had been,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
And in her conversation drawled.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
The Russian N with nasal sound
She would pronounce _ la Franaise_;
But soon she altered all her ways,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Her sentimental verses all,
She soon forgot, began to call
Akulka who was once Celine,
And had with waddling in the end
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Existence calmly sped along,
And oft at eventide a throng
Of friends unceremonious would
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
They growl a bitthey scandalise
They crack a feeble joke and smile
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Olga the tea must supervise
Tis time for supper, now for bed,
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
They in a peaceful life preserved
Customs by ages sanctified,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
When people with long countenance
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
_Kvass_ needful was to them as air;
On guests their servants used to wait
By rank as settled by the State.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
And death before the husband wide
Opened the portals of the tomb
And a new diadem supplied.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
By children and by faithful wife
With deeper woe than others grief.
He was an honest gentleman,
And where at last his bones repose
The epitaph on marble shows:
_Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Servant of God and brigadier,
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here_.
To his Penates now returned,
Vladimir Lenski visited
His neighbours lowly tomb and mourned
Above the ashes of the dead.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Poor Yorick, mournfully he said,
How often in thine arms I lay;
How with thy medal I would play,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
To me he would his Olga give,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Lenski his pencil-case took out
And an elegiac poem wrote.
Likewise an epitaph with tears
He writes upon his parents tomb,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Harvests of souls unceasingly
By Providences dark decree!
They blossom, ripen and they fall
And others rise ephemeral!
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
And our successors soon shall drive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Its insignificance I know
And care but little for its ends.
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
And agitate my heart again;
And thus it is twould cause me pain
Without the faintest trace to leave
This world. I do not praise desire,
Yet still apparently aspire
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
That like a friendly voice its tone
Rescue me from oblivion.
Perchance some heart twill agitate,
And then the stanzas of my theme
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Perish absorbed by Lethes stream.
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Some future ignoramus shall
My famous portrait indicate
And cry: he was a poet great!
My gratitude do not disdain,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Whose memory doth not refuse
My light productions to retain,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The bays of age and helplessness.
The Country Damsel
Whither away? Deuce take the bard!
Good-bye, Onegin, I must go.
I wont detain you; but tis hard
To guess how you the eve pull through.
At Lrinas.Hem, that is queer!
Pray is it not a tough affair
Thus to assassinate the eve?
Not at all.That I cant conceive!
Tis something of this sort I deem.
In the first place, say, am I right?
A Russian household simple quite,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
About the rain and flax and cattle.
No misery I see in that
Boredom, my friend, behold the ill
Your fashionable world I hate,
Domestic life attracts me still,
WhereWhat! another eclogue spin?
For Gods sake, Lenski, dont begin!
What! really going? Tis too bad!
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Present me.You are joking.No.
Delighted.When?This very night.
They will receive us with delight.
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Can we not stealthily make out
What they in conversation said?
How now, Onegin, yawning still?
Tis habit, Lenski.Is your ill
More troublesome than usual?No!
How dark the night is getting though!
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The drive becomes monotonous
Well! Lrina appears to us
An ancient lady full of grace.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
The deuce with my inside has played.
Say, of the two which was Tattiana?
She who with melancholy face
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Hard by the window took her place.
The younger, youre in love with her!
Well!I the elder should prefer,
Were I like you a bard by trade
In Olgas face no life's displayed.
Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Of the horizon she is like!
Vladimir something curtly said
Nor further comment that night made.
Meantime Onguines apparition
At Lrinas abode produced
Quite a sensation; the position
To all good neighbours sport conduced.
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
What jokes and guesses now abound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
In fact, some people were assured
The wedding-day had been arranged,
But the date subsequently changed
Till proper rings could be procured.
On Lenskis matrimonial fate
They long ago had held debate.
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
By such allusions scandalous,
Yet was her inmost soul oerjoyed
With satisfaction marvellous,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Obedient to warm Springs commands.
Long time her young imagination
By indolence and languor fired
The fated nutriment desired;
And long internal agitation
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
She waited forI dont know whom!
The fatal hour had come at last
She oped her eyes and cried: tis he!
Alas! for now before her passed
The same warm vision constantly;
Now all things round about repeat
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
His name: the tenderness of home
Tiresome unto her hath become
And the kind-hearted servitors:
Immersed in melancholy thought,
She hears of conversation nought
And hated casual visitors,
Their coming which no man expects,
And stay whose length none recollects.
Now with what eager interest
She the delicious novel reads,
With what avidity and zest
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
All the creations which below
From happy inspiration flow,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
And that unrivalled paragon,
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A single being: twas in fine
No other than Onegin mine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Of the romances she preferred,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And the bad book accompanies.
Upon those pages she descries
Her passions faithful counterpart,
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
She murmurs in an undertone
A letter for her hero meant:
That hero, though his merit shone,
Was certainly no Grandison.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
And after them at headlong pace
The evanescent fashions fly
In motley and amusing chase.
The world is ever altering!
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Time was, the poets tender quill
In hopes of everlasting fame
A finished madrigal would frame
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Time was, a valiant general might
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Authors replete with sacred fire
Their heroes used to represent
All that perfection could desire;
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Their idols they were wont to invest
With intellect, a taste refined,
And handsome countenance combined,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
The excited hero in a trice
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
And in the final tome we learnt,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
But now our minds are mystified
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Vice in romance is glorified
And triumphs in career erotic.
The monsters of the British Muse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
The idols of their adoration
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Byrons capricious phantasy
Could in romantic mantle drape
Een hopeless egoisms dark shape.
My friends, what means this odd digression?
May be that I by heavens decrees
Shall abdicate the bards profession,
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Thus having braved Apollos rage
With humble prose I'll fill my page
And a romance in ancient style
Shall my declining years beguile;
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
The torment born of crime unseen,
But shall depict the touching scene
Of Russian domesticity;
I will descant on loves sweet dream,
The olden time shall be my theme.
Old peoples simple conversations
My unpretending page shall fill,
Their offsprings innocent flirtations
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Their Jealousy and separation
And tears of reconciliation:
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
But finally in wedlock bind.
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
Accents of rapture or despair
I uttered to my lady fair
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Then they came easily enow,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Thoult suffer, dearest, but before,
Hope with her fascinating power
To dire contentment shall give birth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
Thoult quaff loves sweet envenomed stream,
Fantastic images shall swarm
In thy imagination warm,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
And wheresoeer thy footsteps err,
Confront thy fated torturer!
Loves pangs Tattiana agonize.
She seeks the garden in her need
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
And cares not farther to proceed;
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
And now tis night, the guardian moon
Sails her allotted course on high,
And from the misty woodland nigh
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Nurse, tis so close I cannot rest.
Open the windowsit by me.
What ails thee, dear?I feel depressed.
Relate some ancient history.
But which, my dear?In days of yore
Within my memory I bore
Many an ancient legend which
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
But now my mind is desolate,
What once I knew is clean forgot
Alas! how wretched now my lot!
But tell me, nurse, can you relate
The days which to your youth belong?
Were you in love when you were young?
Alack! Tattiana, she replied,
We never loved in days of old,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Had killed me had the like been told.
How came you then to wed a man?
Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Was younger than myself, my light,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
At last my father gave his blessing,
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
And led me off to church with song.
Then amongst strangers I was left
But I perceive thou dost not heed
Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain
My darling child, thou art in pain.
The Lord deliver her and save!
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.
How thy hands burn!Dear nurse, I'm well.
I amin loveyou knowdont tell!
The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
I am in love, her whispers tell
The aged woman in her woe:
My hearts delight, thou art not well.
I am in love, nurse! leave me now.
Behold! the moon was shining bright
And showed with an uncertain light
Tattianas beauty, pale with care,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
And on the footstool sitting down
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
A kerchief round her silver hair
The aged nurse in ample gown,
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Enchanted by the moons pale beam.
But borne in spirit far away
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
And starting suddenly doth say:
Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go
Good-night. Behold! she is alone!
Tis silenton her shines the moon
Upon her elbow she reclines,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Wherein love innocently pines.
Now it is ready to be sent
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
I have known beauties cold and raw
As Winter in their purity,
Striking the intellect with awe
By dull insensibility,
And I admired their common sense
And natural benevolence,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
For on their brows I trembling read
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
Abandon hope for ever here!
Love to inspire doth woe appear
To suchdelightful to repel.
Perchance upon the Neva een
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Amid submissive herds of men
Virgins miraculous I see,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Alike by sighs and flattery.
But what astonished do I find
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A timid love to banishment?
On fresh allurements they are bent,
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And then with blind credulity
The youthful lover once again
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?
Because in singleness of thought
She never of deception dreamed
But trusted the ideal she wrought?
Because her passion wanted art,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?
Because she was so innocent,
That Heaven her character had blent
With an imagination wild,
With intellect and strong volition
And a determined disposition,
An ardent heart and yet so mild?
Doth loves incautiousness in her
So irremissible appear?
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Without the ken of parents both,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
To the impressions of our youth,
The all-entrancing joys of love
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
The mystic lines to tear away
A lovers letter might convey,
Or into bold hands anxiously
Have eer a precious tress consigned,
Or even, silent and resigned,
When separations hour drew nigh,
Have felt loves agitated kiss
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,
With unanimity complete,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
The sneers of critics superfine;
And you, O maids immaculate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Een as the presence of a snake,
I the same admonition make.
Who knows? with loves consuming flame
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Then to some gallant in your turn
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
The triumph of a conquest new.
The God of Love is after you!
A coquette loves by calculation,
Tattianas love was quite sincere,
A love which knew no limitation,
Even as the love of children dear.
She did not think procrastination
Enhances love in estimation
And thus secures the prey we seek.
His vanity first let us pique
With hope and then perplexity,
Excruciate the heart and late
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Lest jaded with satiety,
The artful prisoner should seek
Incessantly his chains to break.
I still a complication view,
My countrys honour and repute
Demands that I translate for you
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
At Russ she was by no means clever
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And in her native language she
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
So she in French herself expressed.
I cannot help it I declare,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
In Russ her love made manifest,
And never hath our language proud
In correspondence been allowed.
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
I cant conceive a little dear
With the Well-Wisher in her hand!
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,
Did they not all the Russian tongue
With little knowledge and that wrong
In charming fashion mutilate?
Did not their lips with foreign speech
The native Russian tongue impeach?
God grant I meet not at a ball
Or at a promenade mayhap,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Or a professor in tulle cap.
As rosy lips without a smile,
The Russian language I deem vile
Without grammatical mistakes.
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The fair of the next generation,
As every journal now entreats,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Introduce verse in conversation.
But Iwhat is all this to me?
Will to the old times faithful be.
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
With inexact pronunciation
Raises within my breast as oft
As formerly much agitation.
Repentance wields not now her spell
And gallicisms I love as well
As the sins of my youthful days
Or Bogdanovitchs sweet lays.
But I must now employ my Muse
With the epistle of my fair;
I promised!Did I so?Well, there!
Now I am ready to refuse.
I know that Parnys tender pen
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Bard of the Feasts, and mournful breast,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
With this immoderate request
I should alarm our friendship tried:
In one of thine enchanting lays
To russify the foreign phrase
Of my impassioned heroine.
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
I yield with a low reverence;
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Where melancholy rocks arise
He wanders in his indolence;
Careless of fame his spirit high
Hears not my importunity!
Tattianas letter I possess,
I guard it as a holy thing,
And though I read it with distress,
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
Attractive in its banefulness?
I cannot understand. But lo!
A feeble version read below,
A print without the pictures grace,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz score
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Tattianas Letter to Onegin
I write to you! Is more required?
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Tis in your power now, if desired,
To crush me with a just disdain.
But if my lot unfortunate
You in the least commiserate
You will not all abandon me.
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Believe me, of my present shame
You never would have heard the name,
If the fond hope I could have fanned
At times, if only once a week,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To listen to the words you speak,
Address to you one single phrase
And then to meditate for days
Of one thing till again we met.
Tis said you are a misanthrope,
In country solitude you mope,
And wean unattractive set
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Why did you visit our poor place?
Forgotten in the village lone,
I never should have seen your face
And bitter torment never known.
The untutored spirits pangs calmed down
By time (who can anticipate?)
I had found my predestinate,
Become a faithful wife and een
A fond and careful mother been.
Another! to none other I
My hearts allegiance can resign,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
Tis Heavens will and I am thine.
The sum of my existence gone
But promise of our meeting gave,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
My guardian angel to the grave.
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
I heard thy voices resonance
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
And cried within myself: tis he!
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
With thee I conversed when I bore
Comfort and succour to the poor,
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
That glimmered through the radiant night
And gently hovered o'er my head?
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Or torturer malevolent?
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
All this may be an empty dream,
Delusions of a mind untried,
Providence otherwise may deem
Then be it so! My destiny
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And thy protection I implore.
Imagine! Here alone am I!
No one my anguish comprehends,
At times my reason almost bends,
And silently I here must die
But I await thee: scarce alive
My heart with but one look revive;
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Alas! with merited reproach.
Tis finished. Horrible to read!
With shame I shudder and with dread
But boldly I myself resign:
Thine honour is my countersign!
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Her head upon her breast declines
And an enchanting shoulder shines
From her half-open vest of night.
But lo! already the moons light
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Silvers the brook; the shepherds horn
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Tis day, the family downstairs,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
The break of day she doth not see,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
The image of her seal impressed.
But gray Phillippevna the door
Opened with care, and entering bore
A cup of tea upon a tray.
Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My morning birdie, yesternight
I was half silly with affright.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!
Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!
Command me, darling, what you choose
Do notyou mightsuspicious be;
But look youah! do not refuse.
I call to witness God on high
Then send your grandson quietly
To take this letter to O Well!
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell
Command him not to say a word
I mean my name not to repeat.
To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Of late I have been quite absurd,
So many neighbours here exist
Am I to go through the whole list?
How dull you are this morning, nurse!
My darling, growing old am I!
In age the memory gets worse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
In times gone by thy bare command
Oh! nurse, nurse, you dont understand!
What is thy cleverness to me?
The letter is the thing, you see,
Onguines letter!Ah! the thing!
Now dont be cross with me, my soul,
You know that I am now a fool
But why are your cheeks whitening?
Nothing, good nurse, theres nothing wrong,
But send your grandson before long.
No answer all that day was borne.
Another passed; twas just the same.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Olgas admirer came that day:
Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?
The hostess doth interrogate:
He hath neglected us of late.
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick
He promised here this day to ride,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
The post hath kept him, it is like.
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
Shrill sang the _samovar_ at eve,
The china teapot too ye might
In clouds of steam above perceive.
Into the cups already sped
By Olgas hand distributed
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
And a boy handed round the cream.
Tania doth by the casement linger
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And traces with a slender finger
Upon its damp opacity,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears
A horses hoofs she hearsShe shrinks!
Nearer they comeEugene appears!
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
Till out of breath upon a seat
She sank.
Hes here! Eugene is here!
Merciful God, what will he deem?
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Guards fondly hopes uncertain dream.
She waits, on fire her trembling frame
Will he pursue?But no one came.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Singing in chorus all the while.
(This by command; for it was found,
However cherries might abound,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit
Device of rural minds acute!)
The Maidens Song
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Friends and companions,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Come sing we in chorus
The secrets of maidens.
Allure the young gallant
With dance and with song.
As we lure the young gallant,
Espy him approaching,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
And pelt him with cherries,
With cherries, red currants,
With raspberries, cherries.
Approach not to hearken
To secrets of virgins,
Approach not to gaze at
The frolics of maidens.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Tattiana with impatience waited
Until her heart less high should bound
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
More crimson every moment they.
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
With iridescent wing doth flap
When captured in a schoolboys cap;
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
She from the winter corn espies
A sportsman who in covert lies.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And rising from her bench proceeds;
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Tattiana faltered, and became
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
But this adventures consequence
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
I am not strong enough to state;
I, after so much eloquence,
Must take a walk and rest a bit
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Rural Life
La Morale est dans la nature des choses.Necker
The less we love a lady fair
The easier tis to gain her grace,
And the more surely we ensnare
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Time was when cold seduction strove
To swagger as the art of love,
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
But this amusement delicate
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
The Lovelaces are out of date,
Their glory with their heels of red
And long perukes hath vanishd.
For who imposture can endure,
A constant harping on one tune,
Serious endeavours to assure
What everybody long has known;
Ever to hear the same replies
And overcome antipathies
Which never have existed, een
In little maidens of thirteen?
And what like menaces fatigues,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
And husbands tedious amity?
Such were the musings of Eugene.
He in the early years of life
Had a deluded victim been
Of error and the passions strife.
By daily life deteriorated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
And that no longer could inspire.
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Yet satiated with success,
In solitude or worldly din,
He heard his souls complaint within,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Though beauty he no more adored,
He still made love in a queer way;
Rebuffedas quickly reassured,
Jiltedglad of a holiday.
Without enthusiasm he met
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Thus a guest with composure will
To take a hand at whist oft come:
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
And straight returning whence he came,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
And in the morning doth not know
Whither that evening he will go.
However, Tanias letter reading,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
The language of her girlish pleading
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
He called to mind Tattianas grace,
Pallid and melancholy face,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
May be the empire of the sense,
Regained authority awhile,
But he desired not to beguile
Such open-hearted innocence.
But to the garden once again
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Onegin then approached and said:
You have a letter to me sent.
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Confessions which a trusting heart
May well in innocence impart.
Charming is your sincerity,
Feelings which long had ceased to be
It wakens in my breast again.
But I came not to adulate:
Your frankness I shall compensate
By an avowal just as plain.
An ear to my confession lend;
To thy decree my will I bend.
If the domestic hearth could bless
My sum of happiness contained;
If wife and children to possess
A happy destiny ordained:
If in the scenes of home I might
Een for an instant find delight,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
I would desire my bride to be
I say without poetic phrase,
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
As partner of my mournful days,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And be as happyas I might.
But strange am I to happiness;
Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Me your perfections would not bless;
I am not worthy them in aught;
And honestly tis my belief
Our union would produce but grief.
Though now my love might be intense,
Habit would bring indifference.
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
But merely to exasperate;
Judge then what roses would be ours,
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
For us, may be for many a year.
What can be drearier than the house,
Wherein the miserable wife
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
And leads a solitary life?
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Such am I. This did ye expect,
When in simplicity ye wrote
Your innocent and charming note
With so much warmth and intellect?
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
This lot in life with stern decree?
Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
My soul I cannot renovate
I love you with a brothers love,
Perchance one more affectionate.
Listen to me without disdain.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Tis evidently Heavens will
You fall in love again. But still
Learn to possess more self-control.
Not all will like myself proceed
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.
Thus did our friend Onegin preach:
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Attentive listened to his speech,
All breathless and without replies.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
(_Mechanically_, let us add),
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Around the garden homeward hies.
Together they returned, nor word
Of censure for the same incurred;
The country hath its liberties
And privileges nice allowed,
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Onegin acted very well
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
Twas not the first time, I can tell
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Spared him not their asperities.
His friends and also enemies
(One and the same thing it may be)
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Yes! every one must have his foes,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
I've had to make for having friends!
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Dark, unavailing reverie,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
There is no stupid calumny
Born of a babbler in a loft
And by the world repeated oft,
There is no fishmarket retort
And no ridiculous report,
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Where fashionable circles meet
A hundred times will not repeat,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
And yet he in your cause would strive
And loves you asa relative!
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
For your instruction here to tell
What I by relatives conceive?
These are your relatives, believe:
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
With spiritual tenderness;
Whom, as the custom is of men,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Or by a card our homage pay,
That until Christmas comes again
They may forget that we exist.
And soGod bless them, if He list.
In this the love of the fair sex
Beats that of friends and relatives:
In love, although its tempests vex,
Our liberty at least survives:
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The natural fickleness of passion,
The torrent of opinion,
And the fair sex as light as down!
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Should be respected throughout life
By every proper-minded wife,
And this the faithful one allows,
When in as instant she is lost,
Satan will jest, and at loves cost.
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Who words and actions will adjust
To standards in which we believe?
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Who labours hard to humour us?
To whom are our misfortunes grief
And who is not a tiresome thief?
My venerated reader, oh!
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Spare yourself unavailing pain
And all your love on self bestow;
A worthy object tis, and well
I know theres none more amiable.
But from the interview what flowed?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Nor discontinued to distress
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her smile and maidenly repose,
All vanished as an echo goes.
Across her youth a shade had come,
As when the tempests veil is drawn
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Listless is she the livelong day
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Shaking with serious air the head,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
Tis time she to the altar went!
But enough! Now, tis my intent
The imagination to enliven
With love which happiness extends;
Against my inclination, friends,
By sympathy I have been driven.
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
To youthful Olgas beauty bright,
Into delicious bondage gave
His ardent soul with full delight.
Always together, eventide
Found them in darkness side by side,
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
But with confused and bashful air,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
If Olga smilingly approve,
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
To Olga frequently he would
Some nice instructive novel read,
Whose author nature understood
Better than Chateaubriand did
Yet sometimes pages two or three
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
For maidens hearing deemed unfit),
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Far from the rest the pair would creep
And (elbows on the table) they
A game of chess would often play,
Buried in meditation deep,
Till absently Vladimir took
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
Homeward returning, he at home
Is occupied with Olga fair,
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
He leisurely adorns for her.
Landscapes thereon he would design,
A tombstone, Aphrodites shrine,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The in memoriam pages sought,
Where many another hand had signed
A tender couplet he combined,
A register of fleeting thought,
A flimsy trace of musings past
Which might for many ages last.
Surely ye all have overhauled
A country damsels album trim,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
From first to last page to the rim.
Behold! orthography despising,
Metreless verses recognizing
By friendship how they were abused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Upon the opening page ye find:
_Quecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?_
Subscribed, _toujours vous, Annette;_
And on the last one, underlined:
_Who in thy love finds more delight
Beyond this may attempt to write_.
Infallibly you there will find
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
And vows will probably be signed:
_Affectionately yours till death_.
Some army poet therein may
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
In such an album with delight
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
Delighted glances in return;
That afterwards with evil smile
They would not solemnly debate
If cleverly or not I prate.
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Which from the devils bookcase start,
Albums magnificent which scare
The fashionable rhymesters heart!
Yea! although rendered beauteous
By Tolstoys pencil marvellous,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wheneer a brilliant courtly dame
Presents her quarto amiably,
Despair and anger seize on me,
And a malicious epigram
Trembles upon my lips from spite,
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
In Olgas album, youthful maid,
To purest love he tuned his note
Nor frigid adulation paid.
What never was remarked or heard
Of Olga he in song averred;
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
In amorous flights when so inspired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
And all thy precious elegies,
Sometime collected, shall relate
The story of thy life and fate.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
But Olga would not such peruse.
When poets lachrymose recite
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Their own productions, some insist
No greater pleasure can exist
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Who reads his visionary theme
To the fair object of his dream,
A beauty languidly at rest,
Yes, happythough she at his side
By other thoughts be occupied.
But I the products of my Muse,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Companion of my childhoods days.
Or, after dinners dull repast,
I by the button-hole seize fast
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
I sail upon my lake at times
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Take to their wings and fly away.
But to Onegin! _A propos!_
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
His daily occupations, lo!
Minutely I will now portray.
A hermits life Onegin led,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
And clad in airy costume took
His course unto the running brook.
There, aping Gulnares bard, he spanned
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Then dressed himself...
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The uncontaminated kiss
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A bottle of a vintage white
And solitude and calm delight.
Such was Onguines sainted life,
And such unconsciously he led,
Nor marked how summers prime had fled
In aimless ease and far from strife,
The curse of commonplace delight.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
This northern summer of our own,
On winters of the south a skit,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
The tiny sun shone less on high
And shorter had the days become.
The forests in mysterious gloom
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
And many a caravan on high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
A weary season was at hand
November at the gate did stand.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The wolf upon the highways bold
With his ferocious mate appears.
Detecting him the passing horse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
And wisely gallops to the hill.
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Of horn in circle call them round.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Oer all a sheet of silvery dust
(Readers expect the rhyme of _rose_,
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The shining river clothed in ice;
A joyous troop of little boys
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Descends the bank with care extreme,
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Which falls in starry flakes below.
How in the country pass this time?
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
In winter by its blank and dim
And naked uniformity.
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
His footing on the treacherous rime
And may fall headlong any time.
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Keep your accounts! Youd rather not?
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Will pass; the same to-morrow try
Youll spend your winter famously!
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
To idle musing was a prey;
At morn an icy bath within
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Alone within his habitation
And buried deep in meditation,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
A table to the fire is brought,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Bring dinner now without delay!
Upon the table in a trice
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
For the young poet they display.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Its ebullition foaming white
(Like other things I could relate)
My heart of old would captivate.
The last poor obol I was worth
Was it not so?for thee I gave,
And thy inebriating wave
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
And oh! what verses, what delights,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Alas! my stomach it betrays
With its exhilarating flow,
And I confess that now-a-days
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Seductive, animated, bright,
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
Who in the agony of grief
Is ever ready with relief,
Assistance ever will extend,
Or quietly partake our woe.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The golden ember now enshrines,
And barely visible the smoke
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
The goblet still is bubbling bright
Outside descend the mists of night.
How pleasantly the evening jogs
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
Just at the hour we designate
The time between the wolf and dogs
I cannot tell on what pretence
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?
The family are all quite well
Give me just half a glass of wine
They sent their complimentsbut oh!
How charming Olgas shoulders grow!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
She is an angel! We sometime
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
My friend, tis but to pay a debt,
For twice you came to them and yet
You never since your nose have shown.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
They have invited you this week.
Me?Yes! It is Tattianas fte
Next Saturday. The Lrina
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
Make up your mind to go there.Ah!
It will be by a mob beset
Of every sort and every set!
Not in the least, assured am I!
Who will be there?The family.
Do me a favour and appear.
Will you?Agreed.I thank you, friend,
And saying this Vladimir drained
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Then touching Olga they depart
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
He was most gay. The happy date
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The secrets of the marriage state
And loves delicious diadem
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Hymens embarrassments, distress,
And freezing fits of weariness.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
In life domestic see a string
Of pictures painful harrowing,
A novel in Lafontaines style,
My wretched Lenskis fate I mourn,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He was beloved: or say at least,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
The credulous indeed are blest,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Or, parable more flattering,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But wretched who anticipates,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Who every gesture, every phrase
In true interpretation hates:
Whose heart experience icy made
And yet oblivion forbade.
Oh, do not dream these fearful dreams,
O my Svetlana.Joukvski
That year the autumn season late
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
All Nature winter seemed to await,
Till January fell no snow
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Upon the windows tracery,
The trees in silvery array,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
And the far mountains daintily
Oerspread with Winters carpet bright,
All so distinct, and all so white!
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
To labour in his sledge forgot,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Just manages a feeble trot
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Forth the _kibitka_ gallops swift,
Its driver seated on the rim
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Himself transformed into a hack;
To freeze his finger hath begun,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.
In scenes like these it may be though,
Ye feel but little interest,
They are all natural and low,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Another bard with art divine
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
The first appearance of the snows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
He will delight you, I am sure,
When he in ardent verse portrays
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
But competition I abjure
Either with him or thee in song,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The Russian winter did adore
And the cold beauties of the season:
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
These evenings as in days of old
The Lrinas would celebrate,
The servants used to congregate
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And every year distributed
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Tattiana in traditions old
Believed, the peoples wisdom weird,
In dreams and what the moon foretold
And what she from the cards inferred.
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Mysteriously all objects near
A hidden meaning could impart,
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Tattiana certainly infers
That guests approach: and when above
The new moons crescent slim she spied,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
And disappear in space; then she
Would haste in agitation dire
To mutter her concealed desire
Ere the bright messenger had set.
When in her walks abroad she met
A friar black approaching near,
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Had run across her path at speed,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Certain misfortune near opined.
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
In horror for itself alone,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
To peer into the future tries.
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Having lost all in life we prize.
It matters not. Hope een to these
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
On melted wax in water poured;
The clue unto some mystery
She deemed its outline might afford.
Rings from a dish of water full
In order due the maidens pull;
But when Tattianas hand had taen
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
_The peasants there are rich as kings,
They shovel silver with a spade,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Happy and glorious_. But this brings
With sad refrain misfortune near.
Girls the _kashourka_ much prefer.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Sailed silently in unison
Tattiana in the yard appears
In a half-open dressing-gown
And bends her mirror on the moon,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
List! the snow cruncheshe draws nigh!
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
What is your name? The boor looked dazed,
And Agathon replied, amazed.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
By night prepared for sorcery,
And in the bathroom did command
To lay two covers secretly.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Undressed herself and went to bed
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
All covered up with snow in heaps,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
A stream, by winters ice unbound,
Impetuously clove its way
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
Two poles together glued by ice,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Beside the thundering abyss
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Rooted unto the spot remained.
As if against obstruction sore
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
To help her to the other shore
No one appeared to lend a hand.
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And what from its recess appears?
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
He roars, and Ah! Tattiana cries.
He offers her his murderous paw;
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monsters arm,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Passes the torrent But alack!
Bruin is marching at her back!
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Accelerates her hasty pace,
But cannot anyhow evade
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
A forest now she sees in front
With fir-trees standing motionless
In melancholy loveliness,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
The shining orbs of night appear;
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
And all in snow is buried deep.
The wood she entersbear behind,
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
Now a long branch itself entwined
Around her neck, now violently
Away her golden earrings tore;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
For shame lift up the modest maid.
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Until her powers of running fail.
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
Adroitly seized and carried her;
Submissive as if in a swoon,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
He dragged her by a forest road
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
A tangled wilderness around.
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
My chum lives here, Bruin grunts out.
Warm yourself here a little space!
Straight for the entrance then he made
And her upon the threshold laid.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Bear goneshe at the threshold placed;
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
As if it were some funeral feast.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
What doth she see? Around the board
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
A canine face with horns thereon,
Another with cocks head appeared,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
There an imperious skeleton;
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Perched on a gooses neck a skull
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
When in that company she saw
Him who inspired both love and awe,
The hero we immortalize.
Onegin sat the table by
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He knits his browstis silent all.
He there is masterthat is plain;
Tattiana courage doth regain
And grown more curious by far
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Onegin lightning glances shot;
Furious he from the table rose;
All arise. To the door he goes.
Terror assails her. Hastily
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
She cannotthen impatiently
She strains her throat to force a cry
She cannotEugene oped the door
And the young girl appeared before
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
Are turned upon her. All combine
In one great shout: shes mine! shes mine!
Mine! cried Eugene with savage tone.
The troop of apparitions fled,
And in the frosty night alone
Remained with him the youthful maid.
With tranquil air Onegin leads
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
Her shoulderOlga swiftly came
And Lenski followeda light broke
His fist Onegin fiercely shook
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
The unbidden guests he roughly chides
Tattiana motionless abides.
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Struck Lenski deadacross the scene
Dark shadows thickena dread cry
Was uttered, and the cabin shook
Tattiana terrified awoke.
She gazed around herit was day.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Auroras ruddy rays of light
The door flew openOlga came,
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And swifter than the swallows flight.
Come, she cried, sister, tell me een
Whom you in slumber may have seen.
But she, her sister never heeding,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Page after page continued reading,
But no reply unto her made.
Although her book did not contain
The bards enthusiastic strain,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures een,
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor the _Journal des Modes_, I vouch,
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Unto their solitude one day,
This monument of thought profound
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tome of Malvina, and but three
And a half rubles down gave she;
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Tattiana every day conferred
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
She consolation thence obtained
Inseparable they remained.
The dream left terror in its train.
Not knowing its interpretation,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Of such a dread hallucination.
Tattiana to the index flies
And alphabetically tries
The words _bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Et cetera_; but nothing showed
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Though the foul vision promise made
Of a most mournful episode,
And many a day thereafter laid
A load of care upon the maid.
But lo! forth from the valleys dun
With purple hand Aurora leads,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,
And a grand festival proceeds.
The Lrinas were since sunrise
Oerwhelmed with guests; by families
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Latest arrivals salutations,
Barking, young ladies osculations,
Shouts, laughter, jamming gainst the wall,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
Bringing his partner corpulent
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
And the Skatnines, aged pair,
With all their progeny were there,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Ptushkoff, the provincial swell;
Bouynoff too, my cousin, wore
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
And Flinoff, pensioned councillor,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
The family of Kharlikoff,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
In Tanias praise in pouch he brought,
Known unto children perfectly:
_Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie_.
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
He found them in an almanac,
And the sagacious Triquet back
To light had brought them from their dust,
Whilst he belle Nina had the face
By belle Tattiana to replace.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Of old maids the divinity,
And comfort of each country dame,
The captain of a company.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The military band will play.
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
So there will be a dance to-night.
Girls in anticipation skip!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
They hand in hand to table go.
The maids beside Tattiana keep
Men opposite. The cross they sign
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
But by degrees the crowd begin
To raise a clamour and a din:
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They shout and no one lists at all.
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
His entrance with Onegin. Ah!
At last the author! cries Mamma.
The guests make room; aside each takes
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
The friends are called and quickly placed.
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
More timid than a doe long chased,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Anew the flames of passion start
Within her; she is sick at heart;
The two friends compliments she hears
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
The poor girl fell into a faint,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Said something in an undertone
And at the table sat her down.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
And female tears hysterical,
Onegin could not now submit,
For long he had endured them all.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
At a great feast against desire,
And marking Tanias agitation,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
And sulked in silent indignation;
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Triumphant by anticipation,
Caricatures he now designed
Of all the guests within his mind.
Certainly not Eugene alone
Tattianas trouble might have spied,
But that the eyes of every one
By a rich pie were occupied
Unhappily too salt by far;
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Appeared, Dons effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Behind, of glasses an array,
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Made me so tipsy long ago!
From the moist cork the bottle freed
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Triquet arose, and for the bard
The company deep silence guard.
Tania well nigh expired when he
Turned to her and discordantly
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Must bow in common courtesy;
The poet, modest though so grand,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Then handed her the song with grace.
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
But, when Onguines turn came round,
The maidens weary eye which yearned,
Her agitation and distress
Aroused in him some tenderness.
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
But somehow there shone in his look
The witching light of sympathy;
I know not if his heart felt pain
Or if he meant to flirt again,
From habit or maliciously,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
As bees who leave their dainty store
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
And testy gamesters do engage
In boston and the game of age,
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
A strong resemblance these possess
All sons of mental weariness.
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Change of position had essayed,
When tea was brought. Tis my delight
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
And supper. In the country we
Can count the time without much fuss
The stomach doth admonish us.
And, by the way, I here assert
That for that matter in my verse
As many dinners I rehearse,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
Whom thirty centuries adore.
I will with thy divinity
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
But grant with magnanimity
I'm beaten in another matter;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
More advantageously appear
Than cold Onguines oddities,
The aspect of a landscape drear.
Or een Istomina, my dear,
And fashions gay frivolities;
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
No one the contrary will urge,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Again a century should scourge
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Though around honoured Priams throne
Troys sages should in concert own
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
Paris and Menelaus right.
But as to fightingtwill appear!
For patience, reader, I must plead!
A little farther please to read
And be not in advance severe.
Therell be a fight. I do not lie.
My word of honour given have I.
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
But scarce had maids their saucers taen
When in the grand saloon was heard
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
His soul by crash of music fired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
The Paris of those country parts
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
A marriageable maid matured,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Bouynoff whisked off Poustiakova.
All to the grand saloon are gone
The ball in all its splendour shone.
I tried when I began this tale,
(See the first canto if ye will),
A ball in Peters capital,
To sketch ye in Albanos style.
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
My memory wandered wide and sought
The feet of my dear lady friends.
O feet, whereer your path extends
I long enough deceived have erred.
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
Reform me both in deed and word,
And this fifth canto ought to be
From such digressions wholly free.
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Undeviating and insane
As giddy youths hilarity
Pair after pair the race sustain.
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Approaches Olga and the pair
Amid the company career.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Begins to talk of this and that,
But when two minutes she had sat,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
When the mazurka used to peal,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
We glide along a floor of wax.
However, the mazurka lacks
Nought of its charms original
In country towns, where still it keeps
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Fashion is there immutable,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Bouynoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Unto the hero of this lay
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Onegin Olga bore away.
Gliding in negligent career,
He bending whispered in her ear
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
And pressed her handthe crimson blush
Upon her cheek by adulation
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
And hot with jealous indignation,
Till the mazurkas close he stays,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
She fears she cannot.Cannot? Why?
She promised Eugene, or she would
With great delight.O God on high!
Heard he the truth? And thus she could
And can it be? But late a child
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
Cunning already to display
And well-instructed to betray!
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
A pair of bulletsnought beside
His fate shall presently decide.
La, sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi,
Nasce una gente a cui l morir non duole.
Petrarch
Having remarked Vladimirs flight,
Onegin, bored to death again,
By Olga stood, dejected quite
And satisfied with vengeance taen.
Olga began to long likewise
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
And endless the cotillon seemed
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Bedding is laid out and to all
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Up to the attic, and all need
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
To pass the night at home hath gone.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
With better half as cumbersome;
Gvozdine, Bouynoff, Ptushkoff
And Flinoff, somewhat indisposed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In Olgas and Tattianas rooms
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Except one by the window placed
Whom pale Dianas ray illumes
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
But stares into the darkness deep.
His visit she had not awaited,
His momentary loving glance
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
And his strange conduct at the dance
With Olga; nor of this appeared
An explanation: she was scared,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
I shall expire, Tattiana cried,
But death from him will be delight.
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
He _cannot_ give me happiness.
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
A new acquaintance we must scan.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Vladimirs property, a man
Who thrives this moment as I write,
A philosophic anchorite:
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Now of a family the head,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
His ruffian bravery adored,
And true, his pistols faultless aim
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
But I must add to what I write
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Who to surrender did not blench
That every morn at Verreys cost
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Time was, his raillery was gay,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
To make wise men the idiot play
Openly or neath decent cloak.
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Encountered punishment complete,
And sometimes into snares as well
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
He could in disputation shine
With pungent or obtuse retort,
At times to silence would resort,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Quarrels among young friends he bred
And to the field of honour led;
Or reconciled them, it may be,
And all the three to breakfast went;
Then hed malign them secretly
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
_Sed alia tempora_. And bravery
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Diminishes as years decline.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
From storms protection having sought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And lessons to his children read.
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
To friendship making no pretence,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Pervaded with much common sense.
He usually was glad to see
The man and liked his company,
So, when he came next day to call,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
But, after mutual compliments,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Ere conversation could begin,
The epistle from the bard presents.
Onegin to the window went
And scanned in silence its content.
It was a cheery, generous
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Whereto in language courteous
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Onegin, by first impulse moved,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Curtly announcing for the fray
That he was ready any day.
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
He cared no longer there to stay,
Had much to do at home that day,
And so departed. But Eugene,
The matter by his conscience tried,
Was with himself dissatisfied.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Within that secret court discussed,
In much his conduct stigmatized;
For, from the outset, twas unjust
To jest as he had done last eve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
And ought he not to disregard
The poets madness? for tis hard
At eighteen not to play the fool!
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Assuredly should not have been
Conventionalitys dull tool
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
But man of sense and probity.
He might his motives have narrated,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
He ought to have conciliated
That youthful heartBut, now at least,
The opportunity is flown.
Besides, a duellist well-known
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But foolstheir calumnies and sneers
Behold! the worlds opinion!
Our idol, Honours motive force,
Round which revolves the universe.
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
The bard his answer waits at home,
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Triumphant with the answer come.
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
He feared the criminal might try
To treat the matter as a jest,
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
From the dread pistol turn away.
But now all doubt was set aside,
Unto the windmill he must ride
To-morrow before break of day,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
To see his Olga ere the fray
His watch, the sun in turn he views
Finally tost his arms in air
And lo! he is already there!
He deemed his coming would inspire
Olga with trepidation dire.
He was deceived. Just as before
The miserable bard to meet,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Olga ran skipping from the door.
She was as heedless and as gay
Well! just as she was yesterday.
Why did you leave last night so soon?
Was the first question Olga made,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
All silently hung down his head.
Jealousy and vexation took
To flight before her radiant look,
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
But trembles, words he cannot find,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But once more pensive and distressed
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
To mention the foregoing eve,
He mused: I will her saviour be!
With ardent sighs and flattery
The vile seducer shall not dare
The freshness of her heart impair,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
The lilys stem to eat away,
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!
All this, my friends, translate aright:
I with my friend intend to fight!
If he had only known the wound
Which rankled in Tattianas breast,
And if Tattiana mine had found
If the poor maiden could have guessed
That the two friends with mornings light
Above the yawning grave would fight,
Ah! it may be, affection true
Had reconciled the pair anew!
But of this love, een casually,
As yet none had discovered aught;
Eugene of course related nought,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
To the pianoforte he moves
And various chords upon it proves,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
I'm happy, say, is it not so?
But it grew late; he must not stay;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
To the young girl he said adieu,
As it were, tore himself away.
Gazing into his face, she said:
What ails thee?Nothing.He is fled.
At home arriving he addressed
His care unto his pistols plight,
Replaced them in their box, undressed
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But one thought only filled his mind,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Miraculously fair arise,
Vladimir closes up his book,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
With lovers rubbish filled, was neat
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And spouted it with lyric fire
Like D when dinner doth inspire.
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
What will the coming dawn reveal?
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In mist profound all yet is hid.
So be it! Just the laws which bid
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Or innocently past me fly.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Of life or death predestinate.
Blest be the labours of the light,
And blest the shadows of the night.
To-morrows dawn will glimmer gray,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Have entered never to return.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
Will be absorbed by Lethes stream;
Men will forget me, but my urn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Oer my remains to drop a tear,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
For consecrate to me he fell
In the dawn of existence drear.
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Approach, approach; I am thine own.
Thus in a style _obscure_ and _stale_,
He wrote (tis the romantic style,
Though of romance therein I fail
To see aughtnever mind meanwhile)
And about dawn upon his breast
His weary head declined at rest,
For o'er a word to fashion known,
Ideal, he had drowsy grown.
But scarce had sleeps soft witchery
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Into the chamber where he slept
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Onegin waits on us, tis like.
He was in error; for Eugene
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
The pall of night was growing thin,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Upon his couch insensibly;
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
But finally he oped his eyes
And turned aside the drapery;
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He long should have been on the road.
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
And linen on him doth bestow.
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Eugene directs the trusty man
To accompany him and to escort
A box of terrible import.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
Lenski the foemans apparition
Leaning against the dam expects,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Onegin his excuses says;
But, cried Zaretski in amaze,
Your second you have left behind!
A duellist of classic mind,
Method was dear unto his heart
He would not that a man ye slay
In a lax or informal way,
But followed the strict rules of art,
And ancient usages observed
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
My second! cried in turn Eugene,
Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
To this arrangement can be seen,
No obstacle of which I know.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Hes a straightforward little chap.
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Shall we commence?Let it be so,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
In consultation stand aside
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Since leisure was together spent,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Now, like hereditary foes,
Malignant fury they disclose,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Cannot they amicably smile
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Depart in peace and friendly live?
But fashionable hatreds flame
Trembles at artificial shame.
The shining pistols are uncased,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Measured with great exactitude.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
Advance!
Indifferent and sedate,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
With measured step and even gait
Athwart the snow four paces came
Four deadly paces do they span;
Onegin slowly then began
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Took aimbut as immediately
Onegin firedAlas! alas!
The poets hour hath soundedSee!
He drops his pistol silently.
He on his bosom gently placed
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Not agony, but death expressed.
So from the mountain lazily
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
To the youth Eugene hurried now
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
He was no more! The youthful bard
For evermore had disappeared.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
Was withered ere the morning light
The altar flame was quenched in night.
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
His breast was riddled through and through,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Ere this but one brief moment beat
That heart with inspiration sweet
And enmity and hope and love
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
Now, as in a deserted house,
All dark and silent hath become;
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The windows whitened, shutters close
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
With epigrams impertinent,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
His butting horns in anger bent,
The glass unwittingly inspect
And blush to own himself reflect.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Howl like a dolt: tis meant for me!
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For him an honourable grave,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
Placed at the customary range;
But home his body to despatch
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Or any trifle else ye like
You o'er your wine insulted hath
Or even overcome by wrath
Scornfully challenged you afield
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Which in your spirit dominates,
When motionless your gaze beneath
He lies, upon his forehead death,
And slowly life coagulates
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Gazing on Lenskis corse did stand
Zaretski shouted: Why, hes killed!
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Onegin went with trepidation
And the attendants called in haste.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
And hurried home his awful freight.
Conscious of death approximate,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
And homeward like an arrow tore.
My friends, the poet ye regret!
When hopes delightful flower but bloomed
In bud of promise incomplete,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where the admirable streams
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Tender and elevated, free?
And where tempestuous loves desires,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Imaginations sacred fires,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
Resounding through all ages might
Have echoed to eternity.
With worldly honours, it may be,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
It may be that his martyred shade
Carried a truth divine away;
That, for the century designed,
Had perished a creative mind,
And past the threshold of decay,
He ne'er shall hear Times eulogy,
The blessings of humanity.
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
A life in common with the rest;
Vanished his youthful years at last,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
In many things had changed his life
The Muse abandoned, taen a wife,
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
A life of fact, not fiction, led
At forty suffered from the gout,
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And finally, upon his bed
Had finished life amid his sons,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
But, howsoeer his lot were cast,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Poetical enthusiast,
A friendly hand thy life hath taen!
There is a spot the village near
Where dwelt the Muses worshipper,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Within its wave the sounding pail,
And by that shady rivulet
A simple tombstone hath been set.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Upon the meadows showering,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
And the young damsel from the town,
For summer to the country flown,
Wheneer across the plain at speed
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And reads with rapid eager eye
The simple epitapha tear
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
And meditative from the spot
She leisurely away doth ride,
Spite of herself with Lenskis lot
Longtime her mind is occupied.
She muses: What was Olgas fate?
Longtime was her heart desolate
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?
In time I'll give ye without fail
A true account and in detail.
But not at present, though sincerely
I on my chosen hero dote;
Though I'll return to him right early,
Just at this moment I cannot.
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
And now, I mournfully confess,
In rhyming I show laziness.
As once, to fill the rapid page
My pen no longer finds delight,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
In worldly din or solitude
Upon my visions such intrude.
Fresh aspirations I have known,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
And is it true her garland bright
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
And is it true and not a jest,
Not even a poetic phrase,
That vanished are my youthful days
(This joking I used to protest),
Never for me to reappear
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
And so my noon hath come! If so,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
Yet let us part in friendship, O
My frivolous and jolly youth.
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Loves tender transports and distress,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
And all that from thy hand proceeds
I thank thee. In thy company,
With tumult or contentment still
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Commence a new career in life
And rest from bygone days of strife.
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Where my days in the wilderness
Of languor and of love did tell
And contemplative dreaminess;
And thou, youths early inspiration,
Invigorate imagination
And spur my spirits torpid mood!
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Let not the poets spirit freeze,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Eventually petrify
In the worlds mortal revelries,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
And glittering simpletons beside;
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Spoiled children most degenerate
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And stupid censors passionate;
Amid coquettes who pray to God
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
In haunts of fashion where each day
All with urbanity betray,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Amid the awful emptiness
Of conversation, thought and aims
In that morass where you and I
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Moscow, Russias darling daughter,
Where thine equal shall we find?
Dmitrieff
Who can help loving mother Moscow?
Baratynski (_Feasts_)
A journey to Moscow! To see the world!
Where better?
Where man is not.
Griboydoff (_Woe from Wit_)
Impelled by Springs dissolving beams,
The snows from off the hills around
Descended swift in turbid streams
And flooded all the level ground.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The woods, still naked to the view,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The bee forth from his cell of wax
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Herds low, and under nights dark veil
Already sings the nightingale.
Mournful is thine approach to me,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
What agitation languidly
My spirit and my blood doth move,
What sad emotions o'er me steal
When first upon my cheek I feel
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Secure in rural quietude
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Do all things which to mirth incline.
And make a dark existence shine
Inflict annoyance and distress
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?
And is all light within destroyed?
Or, heedless of the leaves return
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
For which no springtime shall appear?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Of a strange night when the moon and
Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Epicurean philosophers,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Of Levshins school ye followers,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
The time for mystic strolls which late
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In coach or post-cart duly placed
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Thou also, reader generous,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Abandon cities riotous,
Which in the winter were a joy:
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
An idle anchorite and sad,
A while ago the winter spent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
My pretty self-deceiving maid
No more the village knows his face,
For there he left a mournful trace.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
The river through the linden wood.
The nightingale there all night long,
Springs paramour, pours forth her song
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And two old pines their branches spread
_Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Who early died a gallant death_,
Thereon the passing traveller read:
_The date, his fleeting years how long
Repose in peace, thou child of song_.
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Above the humble urn of death.
Time was, two maidens from their home
At eventide would hither come,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But nownone heeds the monument
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
As formerly the shepherd sits
And his poor basten sandal knits.
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Thee but a little space bewept,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
By flattery and lovers art
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Mark ye with what a modest air
She bows her head beneath the crown;
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
Passed into dull eternity,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Callous to all on earth become
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The same unmoved oblivion
On us beyond the grave attends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Soon Olgas accents shrill resound
No longer through her former home;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
Back to his regiment must roam.
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Distracted by her grief appears
When the hour came to bid good-bye
But my Tattianas eyes were dry.
Only her countenance assumed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Around the carriage of the pair
Tattiana gently led them there.
And long her eyes as through a haze
After the wedded couple strain;
Alas! the friend of childish days
Away, Tattiana, hath been taen.
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
On whom a sisters heart was set
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
For evermore is separate.
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Into the tangled garden goes
But nowhere can she find repose,
Nor even tears afford respite,
Of consolation all bereft
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
In cruel solitude each day
With flame more ardent passion burns,
And to Onegin far away
Her heart importunately turns.
She never more his face may view,
For was it not her duty to
Detest him for a brother slain?
The poet fell; already men
No more remembered him; unto
Another his betrothed was given;
The memory of the bard was driven
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Two hearts perchance were desolate
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Twas eve. Twas dusk. The river speeds
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Already dance to song proceeds;
The fishers fire afar illumes
The rivers bank. Tattiana lone
Beneath the silver of the moon
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keep
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
A village and beneath, a wood,
A garden by a shining rill.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown
Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
He is not there: I am not known:
The house and garden I would see.
Tattiana from the hill descends
With bated breath, around she bends
A countenance perplexed and scared.
She enters a deserted yard
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
The household troop of little boys,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.
Can I inspect the mansion, please?
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Unto Anicia for the keys
The family of children hie.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Opens unto her visitor.
Into the lonely house she went,
Wherein a space Onegin spent.
She gazeda cue, forgotten long,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The beldam saith: The hearth, by it
The master always used to sit.
Departed Lenski here to dine
In winter time would often come.
Please follow this way, lady mine,
This is my masters sitting-room.
Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
Into accounts would sometimes look,
A book at early morn perused.
The room my former master used.
On Sundays by yon window he,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Was wont with me at cards to play.
God save his soul eternally
And grant his weary bones their rest
Deep in our mother Earths chill breast!
Tattianas eyes with tender gleam
On everything around her gaze,
Of priceless value all things seem
And in her languid bosom raise
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The table with its lamp unlit,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The twilight pale which softens all,
Lord Byrons portrait on the wall
And the cast-iron statuette
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Long in this fashionable cell
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Dark was the valley and the wood
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Long, long the hour had past when home
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
She hid the trouble of her breast,
Heaved an involuntary sigh
And turned to leave immediately,
But first permission did request
Thither in future to proceed
That certain volumes she might read.
Adieu she to the matron said
At the front gates, but in brief space
At early morn returns the maid
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
When in the studys calm retreat,
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
She found herself alone at last,
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
But presently she tried to read;
At first for books was disinclined,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Remarkable. She then indeed
Devoured them with an eager zest.
A new world was made manifest!
Although we know that Eugene had
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Still certain authors, I may add,
He had excepted from the ban:
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
With it may be a couple more;
Romances three, in which ye scan
Portrayed contemporary man
As the reflection of his age,
His immorality of mind
To arid selfishness resigned,
A visionary personage
With his exasperated sense,
His energy and impotence.
And numerous pages had preserved
The sharp incisions of his nail,
And these the attentive maid observed
With eye precise and without fail.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
By what idea or observation
Onegin was the most impressed,
In what he merely acquiesced.
Upon those margins she perceived
Onguines pencillings. His mind
Made revelations undesigned,
Of what he thought and what believed,
A dagger, asterisk, or note
Interrogation to denote.
And my Tattiana now began
To understand by slow degrees
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Whom autocratic fates decrees
Had bid her sigh for without hope
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Which is he? or an imitation,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A Russian in Childe Harolds cloak,
Of foreign whims the impersonation
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Or parody of modern ways?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
But time flies and she doth forget
They long at home have her expected
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
And a long time about her talked.
What can be done? She is no child!
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Olinka is her junior, see.
Tis time to marry her, tis true,
But tell me what am I to do?
To all she answers cruelly
I will not wed, and ever weeps
And lonely through the forest creeps.
Is she in love? quoth one. With whom?
Bouynoff courted. She refused.
Ptushkoff met the selfsame doom.
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
I mused: perhaps the matters squared
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.
But, _mtushka_, to Moscow you
Should go, the market for a maid,
With many a vacancy, tis said.
Alas! my friend, no revenue!
Enough to see one winters end;
If not, the money I will lend.
The venerable dame opined
The counsel good and full of reason,
Her money counted, and designed
To visit Moscow in the season.
Tattiana learns the intelligence
Of her provincial innocence
The unaffected traits she now
Unto a carping world must show
Her toilettes antiquated style,
Her antiquated mode of speech,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Horror! had she not better stay
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Arising with the mornings light,
Unto the fields she makes her way,
And with emotional delight
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
The calm existence which I prize
I yield for splendid vanities,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Whither and wherefore do I speed
And what will Destiny concede?
Farther Tattianas walks extend
Tis now the hillock now the rill
Their natural attractions lend
To stay the maid against her will.
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Another visit hastes to pay.
But Summer swiftly fades away
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
It blew: it howled: till winter een
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
The snow descends and buries all,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
A white and undulating pall
Oer hillock and o'er meadow throws.
The channel of the river stilled
As if with eider-down is filled.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
In mother Winters strange caprice.
But Tanias heart is not at ease,
Winters approach she doth not hail
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
But ultimately doth approach.
Examined, mended, newly found
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The household property contain:
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Basins and jugswell! everything
To happiness contributing.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
A bearded postillion astride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
Unto the gates the servants fly
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
These take their seats; the coach of state
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Shall I behold thee once again?
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
The limits of enlightenment
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
In course of time (the whole extent
Will not five centuries exceed
By computation) it is like
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Highways all Russia will unite
And form a network left and right;
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
Mountains well level and through deep
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
And at the stages bugs and fleas
One moments slumber suffer not.
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
And irritates the appetite.
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Before a fire which feebly glows
Mends with the Russian hammers blows
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
With blessings on the ditches and
The ruts of his own fatherland.
Yet on a frosty winter day
The journey in a sledge doth please,
No senseless fashionable lay
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
For our Automedons are fire
And our swift troikas never tire;
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
And like a palisade flit by.
The Lrinas unwisely went,
From apprehension of the cost,
By their own horses, not the post
So Tania to her hearts content
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
As with innumerable fires.
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When I yon semicircle bright
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Descried before me suddenly!
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
For every loyal Russian breast!
How much is in that word expressed!
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
His recent glory he invokes.
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Napoleon tarried till it please
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Time-honoured Kremlins keys present.
Not so! My Moscow never went
To seek him out with bended head.
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
But lights incendiary flames
For the impatient chief instead.
From hence engrossed in thought profound
He on the conflagration frowned.
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Appear; along the road of Tver
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Past palaces and nunneries,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
And fashionable magazines,
Balconies, lions heads on doors,
Jackdaws on every spirein scores.
The weary way still incomplete,
An hour passed byanothertill,
Near Kharitons in a side street
The coach before a house stood still.
At an old aunts they had arrived
Who had for four long years survived
An invalid from lung complaint.
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And the saloon threw open wide;
The princess from the sofa cried
And the newcomers welcome bade.
The two old ladies then embraced
And exclamations interlaced.
Princesse, mon ange!Pachette!
Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Is it for long?Ma chre cousine!
Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Tis a scene of romance, I vow!
Tania, my eldest child, you know
Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Cousin, remembrest Grandison?
What! Grandison?Yes, certainly!
Oh! I remember, where is he?
Here, he resides with Simeon.
He called upon me Christmas Eve
His son is married, just conceive!
And hebut of him presently
To-morrow Tania we will show,
What say you? to the family
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
See, I can hardly crawl about
But you must both be quite tired out!
Let us go seek a little rest
Ah! I'm so weakmy throbbing breast!
Oppressive now is happiness,
Not only sorrowAh! my dear,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
In old age life is weariness!
Then weeping she sank back distressed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
By the sick ladys gaiety
And kindness Tania was impressed,
But, her own room in memory,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Repose her silken curtains fled,
She could not sleep in her new bed.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
The maiden at her casement sits
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
To consanguineous dinners they
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Contemplate her sad reverie.
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Ever receive with kindly hearts
And exclamations and good cheer.
How Tania grows! Doth it appear
Long since I held thee at the font
Since in these arms I thee did bear
And since I pulled thee by the ear
And I to give thee cakes was wont?
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Oh! how our years are vanishing!
But nothing changed in them is seen,
All in the good old style appears,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helne,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna utters lies,
Ivan Petrvitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petrvitch just as shabby;
Plagie Nikolavna has
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Still of his club he member was
As deaf and silly doth remain,
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
In the beginning, cold and mute,
Moscows young Graces at her stare,
Examine her from head to foot.
They deem her somewhat finical,
Outlandish and provincial,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
Obedient then to Natures law,
With her they did associate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
And oft in whispers would impart
A maidens secretsof the heart.
Triumphstheir own or those of friends
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Their harmless conversation blends
With scandals trivial ornament.
Then to reward such confidence
Her amorous experience
With mute appeal to ask they seem
But Tania just as in a dream
Without participation hears,
Their voices nought to her impart
And the lone secret of her heart,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
She buries deep within her breast
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Tattiana would have gladly heard
The converse of the world polite,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
To find in gossip such delight,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Their slander een was weariness;
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
No sense was ever manifest
Though by an error and unsought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest
Even amusing fools we miss
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In groups, official striplings glance
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
And views amongst themselves advance
Unfavourable unto her.
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
And leaning gainst the portal closed
To her an elegy composed.
Also one Vizemski, remarking
Tattiana by a poor aunts side,
Successfully to please her tried,
And an old gent the poet marking
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
To ask her name the trouble took.
But where Melpomene doth rave
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And heedless of approval seems,
Terpsichore alone among
Her sisterhood delights the young
(So twas with us in former years,
In your young days and also mine),
Never upon my heroine
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The connoisseur his glances throws
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
To the assembly her they bear.
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
The crash of music, candles glare
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The ladies dresses airy, light,
The motley moving mass and bright,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
To strike imagination serve.
Tis there that arrant fops display
Their insolence and waistcoats white
And glasses unemployed all night;
Thither hussars on leave will stray
To clank the spur, delight the fair
And vanish like a bird in air.
Full many a lovely star hath night
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Yet clearer shines than every light
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Shines in the female firmament
Like a full moon magnificent.
Lo! with what pride celestial
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay
For follys dues thou hadst to pay.
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
Gallop, mazurka, waltzingsee!
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Tania, observed by nobody,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And hates the worlds discordant ways.
Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Again her rural life she sought,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The little solitary nook
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
And the lime alleys twilight dim
Where the first time she met with _him_.
Thus widely meditation erred,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
The eyes of a grave general.
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattianas arm a nudge
And in a whisper did repeat:
Look quickly to your left, my sweet!
The left? Why, what on earth is there?
No matter, look immediately.
There, in that knot of company,
Two dressed in uniform appear
Ah! he has gone the other way
Who? Is it that stout general, pray?
Let us congratulations pay
To our Tattiana conquering,
And for a time our course delay,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Let me explain that in my song
I celebrate a comrade young
And the extent of his caprice;
O epic Muse, my powers increase
And grant success to labour long;
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Grant that I err not on the road.
Enough! my pack is now unslung
To classicism I've homage paid,
Though late, have a beginning made.
The Great World
Fare thee well, and if for ever,
Still for ever fare thee well.Byron
In the Lyceums noiseless shade
As in a garden when I grew,
I Apuleius gladly read
But would not look at Cicero.
Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
In spring-time, heard the cygnets note
By waters shining tranquilly,
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Into the study of the boy
There came a sudden flash of light,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Sang childhoods pastimes and its joy,
Glory with which our history teems
And the hearts agitated dreams.
And the world met her smilingly,
A first success light pinions gave,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
Then my companions young with pleasure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
Her utterances ever heard,
And by a partial temper stirred
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
And an encouragement did breathe
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
Passions wild sway I then allowed,
Her promptings unto law did make,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
My sportive Muse I used to take
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Terror of guardians of the night;
And wild festivities among
She brought with her the gift of song.
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And the young revellers of past times
Vociferously paid her court,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Of my light paramour was proud.
But I abandoned their array,
And fled afarshe followed me.
How oft the kindly Muse away
Hath whiled the roads monotony,
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Like Leonora did she ride
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
How oft to the Crimean shore
She led me through nocturnal mist
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
And where the billows hoarsely raise
To God eternal hymns of praise.
Then, the far capital forgot,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
She visited the humble tents
Of migratory gipsy hordes
And wild among them grew her words
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
But suddenly all changed around!
Lo! in my garden was she found
And as a country damsel roved,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
And in her hand a French romance.
Now for the first time I my Muse
Lead into good society,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
With jealous fear, anxiety.
Through dense aristocratic rows
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And supercilious dames she glides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Variety of speech and vests,
Deliberate approach of guests
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Assemblies oligarchical
Please her by their decorum fixed,
The rigour of cold pride and all
Titles and ages intermixed.
But who in that choice company
With clouded brow stands silently?
Unknown to all he doth appear,
A vision desolate and drear
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Pray is it he? It is the same.
And is it long since back he came?
Is he the same or grown more wise?
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
He has returned, say in what guise?
What is his latest character?
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Philanthropist or patriot,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Like you and me and all the rest?
But this is my advice, twere best
Not to behave as he did once
Society he duped enow.
Is he known to you?Yes and No.
Wherefore regarding him express
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Is it that human restlessness
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Is it that ardent souls of flame
By recklessness amuse or shame
Selfish nonentities around?
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
And that too often we receive
Professions eagerly for deeds,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That mediocrity alone
Without disgust we look upon?
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who timely grew mature,
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
By visions who was ne'er deranged
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At thirty who was married well,
At fifty who relief obtained
From public and from private ties,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
And unto whom we all allude
As to a worthy man and good!
But sad is the reflection made,
In vain was youth by us received,
That we her constantly betrayed
And she at last hath us deceived;
That our desires which noblest seemed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
Have one by one all withered grown
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown
Tis fearful to anticipate
Nought but of dinners a long row,
To look on life as on a show,
Eternally to imitate
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
Its passions and its modes of thought.
The butt of scandal having been,
Tis dreadfulye agree, I hope
To pass with reasonable men
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A visionary mortified,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or een the Demon of my strain.
Onguinetake him up again
In duel having killed his friend
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Without profession, business, wife,
He knew not how to spend his life.
Him a disquietude did seize,
A wish from place to place to roam,
A very troublesome disease,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Abandoned he his country seat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Where every day before his eyes
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
And aimless journeys did commence
But still remembrance to him clings,
His travels like all other things
Inspired but weariness intense;
Returning, from his ship amid
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Behind her a grave general.
Her manners were deliberate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
There was no angling for success.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Of affectation innocent,
Calm and without embarrassment,
A faithful model she appeared
Of comme il faut. Shishkff, forgive!
I cant translate the adjective.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Her with a smile old women greet,
The men salute with lower bows
And watch her eyes full glance to meet.
Maidens before her meekly move
Along the hall, and high above
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The general who accompanies.
None could her beautiful declare,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
None could a trace of that impute,
Which in the elevated sphere
Of London life is vulgar called
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
I like this word exceedingly
Although it will not bear translation,
With us tis quite a novelty
Not high in general estimation;
Twould serve ye in an epigram
But turn we once more to our dame.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
At table she was sitting by
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The Nevas Cleopatra, and
None the conviction could withstand
That Ninas marble symmetry,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Could not eclipse her neighbours light.
And is it, meditates Eugene.
And is it she? It must beno
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,
And the eternal lorgnette through
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Seek the forgotten countenance
Familiar to him long ago.
Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
The lady in the crimson cap
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?
The princes eye Onegin seeks:
Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
But stop! I will present thee, if
You choose.But who is she?My wife.
So thou art wed! I did not know.
Long ago?Tis the second year.
To?Lrina.Tattiana?So.
And dost thou know her?We live near.
Then come with me. The prince proceeds,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His relative and friend as well.
The ladys glance upon him fell
And though her soul might be confused,
And vehemently though amazed
She on the apparition gazed,
No signs of trouble her accused,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Her brow she did not een contract
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Not the least trace Onegin sees
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
He conversation would have led
But could not. Then she questioned him:
Had he been long here, and where from?
Straight from their province had he come?
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Unto her husband, went away
Transfixed Onegin mine doth stay.
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Before whom once in solitude,
In the beginning of this lay,
Deep in the distant province rude,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
He salutary rules poured forth?
The maid whose note he still possessed
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Where all upon the surface lies,
That girlbut he must dreaming be
That girl whom once on a time he
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Can she have been a moment gone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
He quits the fashionable throng
And meditative homeward goes,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Do agitate his late repose.
He wakesthey with a letter come
The Princess N. will be at home
On such a day. O Heavens, tis she!
Oh! I accept. And instantly
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
In the recesses what hath stirred
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Again the plague of boyhoodlove?
The hours once more Onegin counts,
Impatient waits the close of day,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
And gallops to her house away.
Trembling he seeks the young princess
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Together moments one or two
They sat, but conversations flow
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Full of exasperating thought.
He fixedly upon her stares
She calm and unconcerned appears.
The husband comes and interferes
With this unpleasant _tte--tte_,
With Eugene pranks of former years
And jests doth recapitulate.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The conversation was revived
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
But round the hostess scintillate
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Awhile sound conversation seems
To banish far unworthy themes
And platitudes and pedantry,
And never was the ear affright
By liberties or loose or light.
And yet the citys flower was there,
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Faces which we meet everywhere
And necessary fools allowed.
Behold the dames who once were fine
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Some marriageable maids behold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Economy political,
And with gray hair ambrosial
The old man who has had his freaks,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
But now ridiculous a bit.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Saint Priest, who every albums page
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Another tribune of the ball
Hung like a print against the wall,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
The traveller, bird of passage he,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Awakens secret merriment
By his embarrassed dignity
Mute glances interchanged aside
Meet punishment for him provide.
But my Onegin the whole eve
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
But the indifferent princess,
Divinity without access
Of the imperial Nevas shore.
O Men, how very like ye are
To Eve the universal mother,
Possession hath no power to please,
The serpent to unlawful trees
Aye bids ye in some way or other
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
How thoroughly her part she took!
How soon to habits she conformed
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Who would the maiden innocent
In the unmoved, magnificent
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
And he had made her heart beat quick!
Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
To end with him her path below.
To Love all ages lowly bend,
But the young unpolluted heart
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
Youth freshens beneath Passions showers,
Develops and matures its powers,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
But at a later, sterile age,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Mournful Loves deadly trace appears
As storms which in chill autumn rage
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And devastate the woods around.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Both day and night he now must pass
In love-lorn meditation sad.
Careless of every social rule,
The crystals of her vestibule
He daily in his drives drew near
And like a shadow haunted her.
Enraptured was he if allowed
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
She seemed of him oblivious,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Received him freely at her house,
At times three words to him addressed
In company, or simply bowed,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
No coquetry was there, I vouch
Society endures not such!
Onguines cheek grew ashy pale,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Onegin wasted; on my word,
Already he grew phthisical.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
And they the waters recommend.
He went notsooner was prepared
To write his forefathers to warn
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Tattianathus the sex is born.
He obstinately will remain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Sickness more courage doth command
Than health, so with a trembling hand
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Though correspondence as a rule
He used to hateand was no fool
Yet suffering emotional
Had rendered him an invalid;
But word for word his letter read.
Onguines Letter to Tattiana
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
Depicted on your haughty face!
What do I ask? What cause assigned
That I to you reveal my mind?
To what malicious merriment,
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Also my wretched liberty
I would not part with finally;
This separated us as well
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
From everything the heart held dear
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Unknown to all, without a tie,
I thoughtretirement, liberty,
Will happiness replace. My God!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
No, ever to behold your face,
To follow you in every place,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
To watch with lovers ecstasies,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Of your perfections in my soul,
Before you agonized to die
This, this were true felicity!
But such is not for me. I brood
Daily of love in solitude.
My days of life approach their end,
Yet I in idleness expend
The remnant destiny concedes,
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
I feel, allotted is my span;
But, that life longer may remain,
At morn I must assuredly
Know that thy face that day I see.
I tremble lest my humble prayer
You with stern countenance declare
The artifice of villany
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
If ye but knew how dreadful tis
To bear loves parching agonies
To burn, yet reason keep awake
The fever of the blood to slake
A passionate desire to bend
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
All that the heart would fain express
Yet with a feigned frigidity
To arm the tongue and een the eye,
To be in conversation clear
And happy unto you appear.
So be it! But internal strife
I cannot longer wage concealed.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
No answer! He another sent.
Epistle second, note the third,
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
To an assemblyshe appeared
Just as he entered. How severe!
She will not see, she will not hear.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
The indignation of her heart!
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Upon her brow sits wrath alone
And it may be a secret dread
Lest the world or her lord divine
A certain little escapade
Well known unto Onegin mine.
Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
Cursing his own stupidity,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Society renounced once more.
Then in the silent cabinet
He in imagination saw
The time when Melancholys claw
Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Caught him and by the collar took
And shut him in a lonely nook.
He read as vainly as before,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Some Russian authors he perused
Nought in the universe refused:
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Wherein I castigation get;
And where a madrigal occurs
Writ in my honour now and then
_E sempre bene_, gentlemen!
But what results? His eyes peruse
But thoughts meander far away
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
His intellect in close array.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
On lines invisible are fixt;
Twas these he read and these alone
His spirit was intent upon.
They were the wonderful traditions
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
The lively trash of stories long
Or letters of a maiden young.
And by degrees upon him grew
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And soon imagination threw
Before him her wild game of chance.
And now upon the snow in thaw
A young man motionless he saw,
As one who bivouacs afield,
And heard a voice cry_Why! Hes killed!_
And now he views forgotten foes,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
A mansionby the window, see!
She sits alonetis ever _she!_
So frequently his mind would stray
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Almost became a poet say
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Indeed, by force of magnetism
A Russian poems mechanism
My scholar without aptitude
At this time almost understood.
How like a poet was my chum
When, sitting by his fire alone
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
He Benedetta used to hum,
Or Idol mio, and in the grate
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Winter resigned her empire white,
Onegin ne'er as poet showed
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
His chambers close wherein confined
He marmot-like did hibernate,
His double sashes and his grate,
And sallied forth one brilliant morn
Along the Nevas bank he sleighs,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
The snow upon the streets doth melt
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Onegin whither gallops? Ye
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The vestibule finds empty quite
He enters the saloon. Tis blank!
A door he opens. But why shrank
He back as from a sudden blow?
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Gazing upon a note below.
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Who now could fail to recognize
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet
She starts, nor doth a word express,
But gazes on Onguines face
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
She comprehends. The simple maid
By fond illusions once possest
Is once again made manifest.
His kneeling posture he retains
Calmly her eyes encounter his
Insensible her hand remains
Beneath his lips devouring kiss.
What visions then her fancy thronged
A breathless silence then, prolonged
But finally she softly said:
Enough, arise! for much we need
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Onegin, hast forgotten yet
The hour whenFate so willedwe met
In the lone garden and the lane?
How meekly then I heard you preach
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Onegin, I was younger then,
And better, if I judge aright;
I loved youwhat did I obtain?
Affection how did you requite?
But with austerity!for you
No noveltyis it not true?
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
But nowmy very blood congeals,
Calling to mind your icy look
And sermonbut in that dread hour
I blame not your behaviour
An honourable course ye took,
Displayed a noble rectitude
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Then, in the country, ist not true?
And far removed from rumour vain;
I did not please you. Why pursue
Me now, inflict upon me pain?
Wherefore am I your quarry held?
Is it that I am now compelled
To move in fashionable life,
That I am rich, a princes wife?
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Is petted by the Emperor?
That my dishonour would ensure
A notoriety proclaimed,
And in society might shed
A bastard fame prohibited?
I weep. And if within your breast
My image hath not disappeared,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Your conversation cold and hard,
If the choice in my power were,
To lawless love I should prefer
And to these letters and these tears.
For visions of my childish years
Then ye were barely generous,
Age immature averse to cheat
But nowwhat brings you to my feet?
How mean, how pusillanimous!
A prudent man like you and brave
To shallow sentiment a slave!
Onegin, all this sumptuousness,
The gilding of life's vanities,
In the worlds vortex my success,
My splendid house and gaieties
What are they? Gladly would I yield
This life in masquerade concealed,
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
For my wild garden and bookcase,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Onguinethe beloved place
Where the first time I saw your face,
Or for the solitary tomb
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Twas possible then, happiness
Nay, nearbut destiny decreed
My lot is fixedwith thoughtlessness
It may be that I did proceed
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Indifferent was her future fate.
I marriednow, I supplicate
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Honour and pride inflexible.
I love youto what end deceive?
But I am now anothers bride
For ever faithful will abide.
She rosedeparted. But Eugene
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
What a storm of emotions keen
Raged round him and of balked desire!
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And Tanias husband soon appeared.
But now our hero we must leave
Just at a moment which I grieve
Must be pronounced unfortunate
For longfor ever. To be sure
Together we have wandered o'er
The world enough. Congratulate
Each other as the shore we climb!
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
To part in amity with thee!
Adieu! whateer thou didst desire
From careless stanzas such as these,
Of passion reminiscences,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Or faults of grammar on its page
God grant that all who herein glance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Or in a squabble to engage,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
Thou also, my ideal true,
And thou, persistent to the end,
My little book. With thee I knew
All that a poet could desire,
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
Of friends the grateful intercourse
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Tattiana in a misty dream,
And my romances open theme
Glittered in a perspective long,
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
As Saadi anciently averred
Some are afar and some are dead.
Without them Eugene is complete;
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
Was drawn, ideal of my lay
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Before the dregs they shall divine
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine
Who the romance do not complete,
But who abandon it as I
Have my Onegin suddenly.
